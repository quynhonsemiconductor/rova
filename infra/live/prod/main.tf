// Structurally identical to ../develop by construction: the entire stack lives in
// ../../modules/stack and only the values below differ. Production takes the
// DEDICATED, durable settings — on-demand Fargate, RDS with deletion protection and
// 30-day backups, 90-day retention, a pinned image tag — while develop takes the
// shared, cheap ones.
//
// LIVE as of this change: service floors of 1, autoscaling on, cache node up, no idle
// schedule, ingress health check on. RDS stays single-AZ on t4g.micro with Enhanced
// Monitoring off — each of those is a costed decision with a named signal that revokes
// it, written above the `rds` block, not deferred maintenance.
//
// Security posture is NOT a per-environment value: the cache module always
// enables KMS at rest and TLS in transit, so develop cannot be the weaker one.

  // regardless of size, so this is 12 containers' worth of material for one fee.

  //
  // HOW THIS WAS VERIFIED WITHOUT A RUNNING TASK. Production was idle when the bundle
  // was cut over (min_count = 0 on both services, RDS stopped, no cache node), so unlike
  // develop nothing booted to prove it. Two checks stood in for that, and both must be
  // repeated if this is ever redone:
  //   1. sha256 per key, bundle vs standalone — all 12 identical (bundle-secrets.sh
  //      --verify).
  //   2. every `<arn>:<key>::` reference in the api, worker AND migrator task
  //      definitions resolved against the bundle exactly as ECS does, confirming the key
  //      is present and non-empty.
  //
  // The migrator is the one to watch. It is NOT covered by a -target on module.api or
  // module.worker, and it was still pointing at the standalone secrets after those two
  // had been cut over — a step-4 destroy at that moment would have deleted secrets it
  // still referenced. Plan the WHOLE stack, not a subset, before dropping standalone.
  //
  // RECOVERABLE FOR 30 DAYS, unlike develop: recovery_window_days = 30 above, so the
  // destroyed containers are scheduled rather than gone. Restore with
  // `aws secretsmanager restore-secret --secret-id rally/production/<name>` inside that
  // window; after it, they must be recreated and re-pasted by hand.

  // request already arrived through Cloudflare — the SPA proxies /v1/* to API_ORIGIN
  // and the ALB security group admitted only Cloudflare edge ranges — so the load
  // balancer was a second TLS termination inside an already-proxied path.
  //
  // Setting this also sets `attach_alb = false`: a tunnel-served task must not
  // simultaneously be an ALB target.
  //
  // MONITORING MOVED, it did not disappear. `monitor_target_health` cannot exist
  // without a target group, so the Route 53 health check created by this module
  // (aws_route53_health_check.api_ingress) is what catches an outage producing no
  // load. It probes rally-api.qnsc.vn/v1/healthz from outside AWS, so it exercises the
  // whole user path rather than any one component's opinion of itself.
  //
  // THAT CHECK IS ON as of go-live — see `monitor_ingress` below. It was off while
  // production served nothing, which was correct then and wrong the moment it served
  // anything.
  //
  // ROLLBACK is not instant: set tunnel_enabled = false, apply, redeploy. That

  // and answered 503 to every request, including the post-deploy readiness check that
  // failed the deploy. Develop only works because its rule was added by hand on

  // this rule (its route form insists on creating its own record and refuses with "A DNS
  // record with this name already exists").
  //
  // The rule the module writes is `api_domain` → `http://localhost:${app_port}`, plus the

  //
  // PROVEN IN DEVELOP FIRST (#447), which is the only reason this is safe to set before

  // cutover, no mixed-architecture window, no rollback plan needed for a live service.
  // This is the last moment that is true.

  // This is production's ONLY ingress alarm while tunnelled. ECS reports a task RUNNING

  //
  // Recreating the node takes ~10 minutes and issues a NEW endpoint. Harmless here — no

  // stopped instance before every deploy either way, so it stays a no-op on a running
  // database.

  // Both halves of rally/production/r2-public-* are populated, so the public-bucket
  // credential can be injected. Same fix as develop: `rally-production-r2-app` is scoped
  // to `rally-prod-attachments` alone, so public-asset writes had no grant. Production
  // has had no users, so nothing has hit it yet — this lands before it can.

  // Step 3, the last one: api and worker stop connecting as the RDS master.
  //
  // Until this, every production connection was `app_admin`, which OWNS every table —
  // so an ordinary HTTP request carried the right to DROP the schema it was reading.
  //
  // The develop-first rule this file used to cite has been satisfied, and it earned its
  // keep: enabling it in develop first is what exposed two `tenant_isolation` RLS
  // policies that denied every file write once the app stopped being the table owner.
  // Had both environments flipped together that would have been a production outage.
  // Migration 0070 dropped those policies, `test/e2e/file-storage-flow.e2e.spec.ts`
  // now fails if RLS ever returns, and this database reports zero RLS-enabled tables.
  //
  // The cutover task ran here on 2026-07-29 (task
  // 747f5e5183c046d6afb399b3810f007e on rally-prod-migrator:15, exit 0). Verified

  // SIZED FOR LAUNCH TRAFFIC, NOT FOR A CHECKLIST. This file's own rule for storage —
  // "raise on evidence, never speculatively" — is applied to the instance class and to

  // flips are deliberately NOT being flipped:
  //
  //   instance_class = "db.t4g.micro", not small.  $13.14/mo, and small is $26.28.
  //     1 GB of RAM against an application whose measured load to date is 4, 1, 0, 1
  //     requests a day. t4g is BURSTABLE, so the failure mode is not a wall: the
  //     instance earns 12 CPU credits/hour at a 10% baseline and spends them on spikes,
  //     and running out degrades gradually into throttling rather than falling over.
  //     RAISE IT ON THIS SIGNAL, and it is the first thing to raise: CPUCreditBalance
  //     trending to zero, or FreeableMemory under ~100 MB, in the AWS/RDS namespace on
  //     the dashboard. Both are on the free native metrics, so no extra spend is needed
  //     to watch for the moment this decision expires. The change is one line and a
  //     ~2-minute reboot — no snapshot, no endpoint change, reversible.
  //
  //   monitoring_interval = 0, not 60.  Enhanced Monitoring bills the OS-level metric
  //     stream to CloudWatch Logs; on a 1 GB instance the per-process and per-device
  //     detail it buys answers a question ("which process") that a single-application
  //     database rarely raises. Performance Insights' free 7-day tier and the native
  //     CPU/memory/IOPS metrics cover the questions that actually get asked. Turn it on
  //     WHEN INVESTIGATING a specific incident, then turn it back off — it takes effect
  //     without a reboot, so it is a debugging tool rather than a posture.
  //
  // Both are cost decisions taken with the size of this workload in evidence, not
  // deferred maintenance. Neither is one-way.
  //
  // Still SINGLE-AZ, and that is the separate, larger decision below.
  //
  //     allocated_storage_gb: raise on evidence, never speculatively (see below)
  //
  // MULTI-AZ IS DELIBERATELY NOT ON THAT LIST — decided 2026-08-02, and it is the one
  // item here that trades availability for cost rather than deferring spend.
  //
  // What it costs: $52.32/mo ($48.18 doubled instance rate + $4.14 mirrored volume at
  // 30 GB), a third of the entire go-live delta and more than every other candidate
  // combined. See docs/go-live-cost-delta.md.
  //
  // What single-AZ means when an AZ fails, stated plainly so nobody rediscovers it
  // during an incident:
  //   - Multi-AZ: AWS fails over to the standby, typically 60-120s, no data loss.
  //   - Single-AZ: the database is DOWN until AWS restores the AZ, or until someone
  //     restores from a snapshot into another AZ. Restore is a manual, multi-hour
  //     operation, and it loses everything written since the last backup — up to 24h
  //     with the current daily automated snapshot, though PITR narrows that to ~5min
  //     within the 30-day backup_retention_days window below.
  //
  // So the exposure is an outage of hours, not a permanent data loss, provided the
  // 30-day retention stays. Do not lower backup_retention_days while single-AZ: PITR is
  // what keeps this a recoverable outage rather than a real loss event.
  //
  // REVISIT WHEN: the product carries paying users, an availability commitment (SLA,
  // contract, SOC 2 CC7.x continuity), or a workload where hours of downtime costs more
  // than $52/mo. Turning it on later is a single flag plus an apply — RDS converts a
  // single-AZ instance to Multi-AZ in place, with a brief failover, no data migration
  // and no endpoint change. Nothing about this decision is one-way.
  //
  // Multi-AZ does NOT affect the deploy pipeline either way: the `ensure_rds` step in
  // qnsc-ci's backend-deploy reusable checks status and starts a stopped instance
  // regardless of AZ topology, so it is a no-op on an always-available database.
  //
  // 30 GB, not 100: `max_allocated_storage_gb` below already autoscales, and RDS gp3
  // gives the same 3,000 baseline IOPS and 125 MiB/s at every size under 400 GB, so
  // over-allocating buys nothing. Treat any increase as PERMANENT — RDS refuses to
  // shrink a volume and a snapshot restore cannot land smaller, so coming back down

  // ── LIVE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  // `min_count = 1` on both services, ending the pre-launch idle. Production ran zero
  // tasks from 2026-08-02 to go-live because it had never served a user — the ALB logged
  // 4, 1, 0, 1 requests on four consecutive days — while costing ~$52/mo in on-demand
  // Fargate, a third of the account.
  //
  // A FLOOR OF 1 IS NOT A HIGH-AVAILABILITY POSTURE, and nothing here claims it is. One
  // api task means an AZ event or a task replacement is a brief outage; autoscaling adds
  // the second task under load, not for redundancy. Raising the floor to 2 is $22.46/mo
  // for the api and the right change once there are users who notice a 30-second gap —
  // which is a traffic decision, not a launch-day one.
  //
  // AUTOSCALING IS ON, and it only works because of the floor. With a floor of 0 the
  // scalable target could do nothing: target tracking scales proportionally so it never
  // computes zero from a running task, and a service at zero tasks publishes no CPU or
  // memory metric to scale out from. Measured on this account during the idle: production
  // sat at 0/0 tasks for days with a registered target, and Application Auto Scaling
  // logged ZERO scaling activities across its full six-week retention. A `validation`
  // block on the stack module's `api` and `worker` variables enforces the pairing, so
  // this combination cannot drift apart in one direction without the plan failing.
  //
  // `desired_count` is under `ignore_changes`, so the deploy pipeline setting it is
  // expected and non-drifting. Note the consequence now that the floor is 1: scaling a
  // service to zero by hand no longer sticks — Application Auto Scaling restores it
  // within minutes. Stopping production means changing this file.
  //
  // RDS runs continuously too. Run-state is not a Terraform concept, so the instance was
  // stopped out of band during the idle and `idle_schedule` re-stopped it against the
  // 7-day force-start; that schedule is now removed above.
  //
  // SIZED FROM MEASUREMENT. 1024/2048 originally, then 512/1024, now 256/1024 — and
  // this last step is the only one of the three taken with data rather than judgement.
  //
  // THE DATA, AWS/ECS on rally-develop, 14 days to 2026-08-17, same image and same
  // workload as production will run:
  //
  //     api  512/1024   CPU avg 0.8%, peak 100%   Memory avg 14.2%, PEAK 25.9%
  //
  // Peak memory of 25.9% on a 1024 MB task is 265 MB. The CPU peaks are real but they
  // are BOOT AND MIGRATION bursts a minute long against a 0.8% average — not load.
  // Provisioning 0.5 vCPU to make those bursts finish faster is paying $9.23/mo for a
  // shorter cold start.
  //
  // MEMORY DELIBERATELY NOT HALVED. 256/512 is available and $2.02/mo cheaper, and it is
  // declined: 265 MB against 512 MB is 52% before production adds anything develop does
  // not have — real sessions, held-open SSE streams, a warmer connection pool. Two
  // dollars is not the right price for that margin. CPU is where the waste was.
  //
  // WHAT THIS COSTS: a slower cold start. That is a DEPLOY-duration cost, not an
  // availability one — the rolling deployment starts the replacement before draining the
  // old task — but it also lengthens the gap when a single task is replaced unexpectedly.
  // Watch it after go-live.
  //
  // HEADROOM IS max_count = 10, not task size. Production absorbs a spike by ADDING

  // FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED, retries with exponential backoff, and every write is an
  // idempotent upsert — so a task disappearing mid-batch loses no work, it just leaves
  // the rows claimed-then-released for the next tick. Spot's two-minute interruption
  // notice is longer than a 5-second relay cycle needs.
  //
  // That is not true of the api, which is why it stays on-demand: an interruption there
  // is a request nobody retries and an SSE stream that drops. Interruptions are real, not
  // hypothetical — `SpotInterruption` already appears in develop's stopped-task reasons.
  //
  // SIZED FROM MEASUREMENT, at 256/512 — the size develop has run all along, so this is
  // production adopting a proven number rather than guessing a smaller one.
  //
  //     worker  256/512   CPU avg 1.5%, peak 100%   Memory avg 20.7%, PEAK 35.8%
  //
  // AWS/ECS on rally-develop, 14 days to 2026-08-17. Peak memory of 35.8% on 512 MB is
  // 183 MB. As with the api, the CPU peaks are relay-tick and boot bursts against a 1.5%
  // average, not sustained load.
  //
  // Production's outbox carries the SAME work develop's does per unit of traffic, and
  // production currently has less of it. `max_count = 6` is the headroom, and the relay
  // is horizontally scalable by construction — FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED means a second
  // task claims different rows rather than contending for the same ones.
  //
  // Saves $3.48/mo against 512/1024, on top of Spot below.
  //
  // SPOT saves a further $7.77/mo at this size ($11.25 on-demand versus $3.48 on Spot).
