# ── RDS wake guard — develop deploy role only ────────────────────────────────
# Allows the CI deploy job to detect + start a stopped RDS instance before running
# migrations. Scoped to develop only, and deliberately absent from the production
# deploy role.
#
# The STOPPING half exists too, which this comment used to deny. `idle_schedule` in
# infra/live/develop/main.tf creates three EventBridge schedules — rds-stop,
# api-scale-down, worker-scale-down — and CloudTrail confirms them firing nightly.
#
# So the two halves are a LOOP, and this grant is what closes it: the schedule stops
# develop at 21:00 and 03:00, and the next deploy's `ensure_rds` starts it again. That
# pairing is the whole cost posture, not a safety net for manual teardown.
#
# It also has to be understood as a loop to be reasoned about. The schedule ran nightly
# for weeks while develop stayed up 24/7, because a single 21:00 stop could not hold
# against a wake signal that fires whenever a deploy lands — measured 2026-08-02, fixed
# by adding a second 03:00 pass. Removing this grant does not save money; it breaks
# waking and leaves deploys failing against a stopped database.
#
# The ARN is constructed directly (account_id + region + fixed identifier)
# instead of via a `data "aws_db_instance"` lookup. A data-source lookup
# fails hard whenever the instance doesn't exist yet or has been torn down
# (e.g. a fresh deploy, or a full teardown+redeploy cycle) — this stack
# would then be unable to apply/destroy independently of develop's RDS
# lifecycle. An ARN string doesn't require the resource to exist.

# ── RDS wake guard — PRODUCTION deploy role ──────────────────────────────────
# This grant was deliberately ABSENT until production was idled, and the reason it is
# here now is a posture change rather than a loosening: production's instance is
# STOPPED on purpose until go-live (see `min_count = 0` and `idle_schedule` in
# ../prod/main.tf), so waking it is a normal step of deploying rather than an
# exception to be denied.
#
# Without it, idling production silently broke the release pipeline: the deploy would
# reach `Run database migrations` and fail against a stopped instance, with the cause
# two repos away from the symptom. Two releases were cut the same day the idle landed,
# so this is not hypothetical.
#
# Still Start and Describe only — never Stop. Stopping is the scheduler's job and it
# has its own narrowly-scoped role; a deploy role that can stop production is a
# deploy that can cause an outage.
#
# REMOVE AT GO-LIVE together with the idle settings. Once production is meant to be
# running continuously, a deploy role able to start a stopped database is again the
# exception it used to be, and its absence is what makes an accidental stop loud.

# ── Outbound email (SES) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The domain identity itself (aws_sesv2_email_identity + its DKIM/mail-from Cloudflare records) moved
# to qnsc-infra/live/edge (2026-08-31) — see that stack for why. This stack only owns the bounce/
# complaint feedback loop below, which IS product-scoped: each product tags its sends with its own
# configuration set and drains its own queue. `rally`'s IAM send grant (infra/modules/stack/main.tf)
# constructs the identity ARN directly (arn:aws:ses:<region>:<account>:identity/<domain>) rather than
# reading it from here, so this stack has no dependency on qnsc-infra/edge having applied first.

# ── SES asynchronous feedback: bounce and complaint events ──────────────────
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `EMAIL_PROVIDER=ses` answers 200 before the receiving mail server has said
# anything, so acceptance and delivery are different facts — and the app could only see the first.
# An invitation the inviter saw as "sent" could be hard-bounced or tenant-quarantined on the other
# end, with silence as the only symptom (that exact case cost a multi-day investigation: every local
# signal green, the invitee never saw mail). This loop makes the second fact visible: a
# configuration set tags every send, SES publishes BOUNCE/COMPLAIT events to SNS, SNS fans out to
# SQS, and the worker's BounceFeedbackService drains the queue onto the email_outbox row that sent.
#
# SNS IN THE MIDDLE IS NOT A CHOICE: SES event destinations speak SNS, Kinesis or EventBridge —
# never SQS directly. SQS at the end IS a choice: no public HTTPS endpoint to signature-check, no
# Cloudflare in the blast radius, and the consumer sits beside the relay that wrote the rows.
# Default (envelope) delivery, deliberately: the consumer parses SNS's `Message` field, which is
# the SES event JSON — raw_message_delivery would strip the envelope the code expects.
#
# Shared like the identity above: one configuration set per (account, region), both environments
# send through it, and each environment's worker drains from the one queue. A verdict's row is
# matched by SES message id, so cross-environment events cannot land on the wrong row even if both
# workers race — the guarded UPDATE answers whichever row owns that id.
# No `delivery_options`: the pinned AWS provider predates that argument on this
# resource, and Require is SES's own default for a domain-verified identity anyway.
