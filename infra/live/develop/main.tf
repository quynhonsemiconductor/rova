  // nodes holding a few thousand keys between them. The runtime layer already owned the
  // security group and the data subnets; only the node was duplicated.
  //
  // Saves $15.45/mo across the account. Created in quynhonsemiconductor/infra#69.

  // DATABASE 0. qnsc-kb takes database 1. The index is enforced by the server rather than
  // by a key-prefix convention every library has to honour — cluster mode is disabled on

  // THERE IS NOW A MATCHING START SCHEDULE — see `wake_schedule` below. This comment
  // used to say there was none "on purpose", on the grounds that the deploy pipeline is
  // the wake signal and a morning start would pay for the days nobody touches develop.
  // The first half is still true and is why the wake is WEEKDAYS ONLY. The second half
  // was wrong about which days matter: it counted the days develop is CHANGED and
  // ignored the days it is USED. A QA session on a morning nobody merged found the
  // environment stopped, which reads as an outage, and RDS takes ~4-5 minutes to start,
  // so it cannot be waited out.
  //
  // TWO PASSES, 00:00 AND 03:00 — because ONE was not holding. Measured 2026-08-02:
  // develop's RDS published CPU datapoints for every hour of every night across seven
  // days, i.e. it was never actually down. CloudTrail shows why:
  //
  //   21:00:36  StopDBInstance   (this schedule — fires correctly, every night)
  //   21:33:07  StartDBInstance  (GitHubActions — `ensure_rds` in the deploy reusable)
  //
  // A deploy landing after the stop wakes RDS and scales the services back up, and
  // nothing stopped them again until the FOLLOWING night. 6 of 40 sampled deploys ran at
  // 21:00-02:00 local, so develop was billing ~24h/day for maybe 10h of use. This is a
  // control-loop problem, not a sizing one: a once-daily stop cannot hold against a wake
  // signal that fires at any hour.
  //
  // FIRST PASS MOVED 21:00 -> 00:00 (2026-08-06), because 21:00 was cutting into use.
  // The 03:00 backstop is what makes this affordable: the measurement above shows the
  // damage comes from a deploy landing AFTER the stop and leaving the environment up all
  // night, not from the hour of the stop itself — and 03:00 still catches that. The cost
  // of the move is bounded at 3 extra hours on nights nobody deploys late, ~$0.15/night.
  //
  // Note this narrows the late-evening deploy window from 6h to 3h: a deploy at 01:00
  // now leaves develop up for only two hours instead of five. That is a saving, not a
  // problem, but it means the two passes are closer together than they look — if a third
  // pass is ever wanted it belongs BEFORE 00:00 (e.g. a 20:00 pass for a team that stops
  // earlier), not between these two.
  //
  // 03:00 is chosen to sit after the late-evening deploy window and before the working
  // day. A deploy at 02:00 still gets its environment; one at 01:00 no longer leaves it
  // running all night. If deploys routinely land between 03:00 and 08:00, add a pass
  // rather than moving this one — 08:00 is now the wake, so a stop after it would fight
  // `wake_schedule` below.
  // THREE passes now, and the first one is the change: 19:00 ends the working day,
  // 22:00 catches an evening deploy, 02:00 catches a late one. Was `0,3`.
  //
  // 19:00 is what moves the money. Develop was up 08:00-00:00, so five of those sixteen
  // hours were after everyone had stopped. Measured across both develop environments
  // (rally and qnsc-kb), the 19:00-00:00 tail is ~$8.13/mo of RDS and Fargate.
  //
  // THE LATE PASSES ARE NOT OPTIONAL, and dropping to a single 19:00 stop is the obvious
  // "simplification" that breaks this. A deploy at 20:00 wakes develop; with nothing after
  // 19:00 it would then stay up until the NEXT working day's stop — 23 hours, which is
  // worse than the schedule this replaces. Each pass is a no-op when develop is already
  // down (InvalidDBInstanceState, deliberately not retried).
  //
  // A pass between 02:00 and 08:00 would be pointless: nothing wakes develop in that
  // window except a deploy, and 02:00 already caught the previous evening's.
  # 00:00 and 03:00 Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh. Moved back from 19:00 on request 2026-08-19: a 19:00
  # stop cut the evening short, and develop being down while somebody is still working costs
  # more in interruption than the hours save.
  #
  # WHAT IT COSTS: +$3.90/mo for this stack. 55h/week becomes 80h (16h x 5 days), so RDS
  # instance-hours and Fargate both rise ~45%. The weekday-only wake below is what keeps
  # this from being the old 112h/week schedule — weekends are still the larger saving and
  # they stay off.
  #
  # TWO PASSES, and the second is not optional. 00:00 ends the day; 03:00 catches a deploy
  # that landed late and woke the environment, because nothing else would put it back down
  # until the next working day. Each pass is a no-op when develop is already down
  # (InvalidDBInstanceState, deliberately not retried).

  // 08:00 local, EVERY DAY. This was MON-FRI first, on the argument that a 7-day wake
  // "would pay for two days a week nobody works". Two weekends in, that argument had
  // been falsified twice: somebody wanted develop on a Saturday both times, found it
  // stopped, and it had to be started by hand — which takes SEVEN MINUTES of waiting
  // (measured 2026-08-08, not the ~4-5 estimated here before), during which the person
  // cannot do the thing they sat down to do.
  //
  // The weekday restriction was optimising the wrong quantity. Two extra wake-days cost
  // about $2.50/mo against a ~$50/mo environment — 5% — to remove a recurring
  // interruption and the standing question "is develop up today?". The nightly stop is
  // where the real saving always was, and that is untouched.
  //
  // 08:00 rather than 09:00 because RDS takes ~7 minutes to reach `available` and the
  // API tasks then need to pass a readiness check, so the environment is serving by
  // roughly 08:10 — before the working day rather than during its first minutes.
  //
  // This does NOT conflict with the 03:00 stop above. 03:00 fires while develop is
  // already down (a no-op, InvalidDBInstanceState, deliberately not retried) and 08:00
  // brings it up five hours later. The 00:00 stop then ends the day. A deploy landing at
  // any hour still wakes it independently — that path is unchanged, and it is what makes
  // the weekday-only wake safe.
  //
  // WEEKENDS REMOVED AGAIN (was `* * ?`, daily). This reverses #408, and the reversal is
  // about arithmetic rather than a change of mind.
  //
  // #408 bought weekend availability for "about $2.50/mo". That number was too low: it
  // priced RDS alone, at a rate taken from memory, for one product. Measured from Cost
  // Explorer across BOTH develop environments — unblended cost divided by usage quantity,
  // 2026-08-01..16 — the weekend share of develop's RDS and Fargate is ~$10.42/mo. The
  // decision was sound at $2.50 and does not survive at four times that, against a target
  // of $100/mo for the whole account.
  //
  // What it costs: develop is DOWN on Saturday and Sunday unless someone deploys. That
  // path is unchanged and automatic — the `wake` job in qnsc-ci's backend-deploy reusable
  // starts RDS and both services before the deploy proceeds, so weekend work costs a wait
  // of a few minutes, not a manual step or a support request. It is the same mechanism
  // that already covers a 07:00 start on a weekday.
  //
  // Expected effect: develop is up 08:00-00:00 on weekdays, 80h/week rather than 112.
  //
  // VERIFIED FIRING, so a future failure is a regression and not "it never worked":

  // restores services scaled to 0 and calls `ensure_rds` to start a stopped instance,
  // and `_shared` already grants the develop deploy role `rds:StartDBInstance`. Every
  // merge to main therefore brings develop up on its own. `idle_schedule` below
  // puts it back down nightly.
  //
  // AUTOSCALING IS OFF HERE, and that is the load-bearing part.
  //
  // Deploys and `idle_schedule` between them own the desired count, so the floor has to
  // be 0 — with a floor of 1 Application Auto Scaling restores the service within minutes
  // and the midnight scale-to-zero undoes itself.
  //
  // But a scalable target with a floor of 0 cannot act at all, in either direction. Target
  // tracking scales proportionally, so from one task at ~1% CPU it computes
  // ceil(1 x 1/65) = 1 and never reaches zero; and once the schedule has taken the service
  // to zero there is no CPU or memory metric left for it to scale out from. Measured here,
  // not assumed: develop ran for hours at 0.07-1.0% average CPU against a floor of 0, and
  // Application Auto Scaling logged ZERO scaling activities across its six-week retention.
  //
  // So autoscaling was never fighting the schedule — it was inert, while billing four
  // CloudWatch alarms per service. `enable_autoscaling = false` says that out loud and
  // leaves exactly one writer: `desired_count` is under `ignore_changes` in the
  // ecs-service module, the deploy sets it to 1, the nightly schedule sets it to 0.
  //
  // Losing it costs develop nothing regardless: no users to absorb a spike for, and
  // `max_count` was never approached. Production restores it at go-live along with a floor
  // of 1 — see ../prod/main.tf, and the validation that ties those two together.
