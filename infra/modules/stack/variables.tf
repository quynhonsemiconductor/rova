    an injected Secrets Manager secret holds no value, so injecting these before they are

    Two-step, same shape as `db_least_privilege`. Before flipping it, in this environment:

      2. put both halves into the `r2-public-access-key-id` /
         `r2-public-secret-access-key` secrets.
    Then set this true.

    While false, StorageService reuses the PRIMARY credential for both buckets — and in
    this account that credential is scoped to `<product>-<env>-attachments` alone, so every
    public-asset write 403s. Turning this on is therefore a FIX, not hardening. An earlier
    version of this text called the false path "the behaviour that predates the split" as

    three tasks connect as the master user, which OWNS every table: an ordinary
    HTTP request carries rights to DROP the schema it is reading, and any
    row-level policy is skipped, because Postgres exempts a table's owner from
    RLS unless FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY is also set. That exemption is what made
    the RLS layer in migration 0005 inert.

    This is the LAST of three steps, and the order is not fully enforceable in
    Terraform. Before flipping it, in this environment:
      1. `pnpm db:migrate` has run, so migration 0068 has created the roles;
      2. the `db-app-password` / `db-worker-password` secrets hold a value, and
         `db_role_passwords_set` is true;
      3. the cutover task has run, applying those values with
         `ALTER ROLE ... LOGIN PASSWORD ...` (see `db_role_passwords_set`).
    Flip it first and the tasks boot, fail to authenticate (28P01) and roll back.
    Step 2 is enforced by the validation below; step 3 cannot be, because Terraform
    has no way to observe `pg_roles`.

    The MIGRATOR is deliberately unaffected — it needs DDL, and narrowing it
    means transferring schema ownership, a separate and more disruptive step.

    A SEPARATE flag from `db_least_privilege`, and it has to be. The two steps are
    strictly ordered — the roles need a password before anything authenticates as
    them — and each flag drives a different workload:

      db_role_passwords_set = true   → migrator can read the passwords, so the

      db_least_privilege    = true   → api and worker authenticate as those roles

    Folding them into one flag makes the cutover impossible: a single apply would
    both hand the migrator the passwords and point the runtime at roles that are
    still NOLOGIN, so api and worker fail with 28P01 before the cutover task could
    run. Hence two flags, flipped in two applies.

    OFF by default for the same reason `storage_public_credentials` is: the deploy
    preflight refuses to deploy while an INJECTED Secrets Manager secret is empty,

    Cron/rate expression for an EventBridge Scheduler that IDLES this environment:
    stops the RDS instance AND scales both services to zero. Null (the default) creates
    no schedules, no role and no policy.

    Both halves matter. Stopping only the database leaves Fargate tasks running against
    an instance they cannot reach — still billed, unable to serve, and invisible,
    because `healthz` answers 200 regardless so the ALB keeps them registered.

    Required for any environment that is deliberately idle, because AWS FORCE-STARTS a
    stopped RDS instance after seven days. Without a recurring re-stop the instance
    quietly comes back and the saving disappears with nothing reporting it.

    MUST FIRE AT LEAST DAILY. This used to read "every Sunday 01:00 local — comfortably
    inside the 7-day window: cron(0 1 ? * SUN *)", and that example was wrong in a way
    both products copied.

    The 7-day window bounds when AWS force-STARTS the instance, not how long it then runs.
    Stop it on Sunday, AWS starts it the following Sunday, and the next weekly pass is up
    to seven days after that. So a weekly re-stop bounds the exposure at seven days rather
    than one. Measured on rally-prod under exactly that expression: 59 of 168 hours in a
    week published CloudWatch datapoints — a pre-launch database with no users, no tasks
    and no cache node running 35% of the time, roughly $4/mo for nothing.

    Daily costs nothing extra. Stopping an already-stopped instance fails with
    InvalidDBInstanceState, which is the DESIRED state rather than an error, so the target
    is configured with no retries and no dead-letter queue — and the ECS half scales
    services that a zero floor already holds at zero.

    Expression is evaluated in Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh. A daily pass, and develop's two-pass
    form (see the note above about deploys waking the environment):

        cron(0 1 * * ? *)        production, pre-launch
        cron(0 0,3 * * ? *)      develop

    See `wake_schedule` for the reverse. The two are independent on purpose: an
    environment may idle with no wake (production before go-live) but must never wake
    with no idle, which `check "wake_requires_idle"` enforces.

    Cron/rate expression for the REVERSE of `idle_schedule`: starts the RDS instance and
    scales both services back to their configured counts. Null (the default) creates no
    wake schedules, no role and no policy — which is the correct setting for production,
    where the only intended wake is a release.

    This exists because "the deploy pipeline is the wake signal" is not sufficient on its
    own. It is correct that develop should be up on the days it is being CHANGED, but it
    also has to be up on the days it is being USED — a QA session on a morning nobody
    merged found the environment stopped, which reads as an outage rather than as a
    saving. RDS takes ~4-5 minutes to become available, so this cannot be fixed by
    waiting.

    A DAILY wake is usually the right shape, not a weekday-restricted one:

        cron(0 8 * * ? *)

    This variable's first version recommended MON-FRI, on the reasoning that a 7-day wake
    "pays for two days a week nobody works". Develop was set that way and the reasoning
    did not survive contact: people did work weekends, found the environment stopped, and
    had to start it by hand — a ~7 minute wait each time. Two extra wake-days are ~$2.50/mo
    against a ~$50/mo environment, which is a poor trade against a recurring interruption.

    Restrict to weekdays only where nobody CAN use the environment at a weekend (a shared
    QA environment for one office, say), not merely where nobody is expected to.

    Note the saving lives in `idle_schedule`, not here — the nightly stop is what takes
    the environment to zero. Widening the wake trims that saving at the edges; it does not
    remove it.

    Expression is evaluated in Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh, like `idle_schedule`.

    A SEPARATE IAM role from the idler, deliberately. The idler's policy is documented
    stop-only on the grounds that "a role that can also start an instance turns a
    scheduling mistake into a cost increase" — that reasoning survives here by keeping
    the grants split, so a fault in one schedule cannot undo the other. The waker holds
    rds:StartDBInstance and ecs:UpdateService; the idler still holds no start permission
    of any kind.

    THE WAKE COUNT IS 1, NOT min_count. This is the subtle part. `min_count = 0` is
    exactly what lets an idled service STAY at zero — with a floor of 1, Application Auto
    Scaling restores the service within minutes and the idle never holds (see
    api.min_count). So the floors cannot be raised to describe the woken state, and this
    schedule cannot read them. It writes a literal DesiredCount = 1, which is the same
    count the deploy pipeline sets, so a wake and a deploy converge on one answer.

    Consequence worth stating: this env has THREE writers of desired_count now — the
    deploy, `idle_schedule`, and this. All three set it out of band, which is sanctioned
    because `desired_count` is under `ignore_changes` in the ecs-service module. A fourth
    writer (a scheduled autoscaling action) would NOT be, and is why this is built as
    ecs:UpdateService.

  description = <<-EOT
    Serve this environment's api through a Cloudflare Tunnel sidecar instead of the
    shared ALB.

    An ALB costs $18.40/mo plus $3.65 per enabled AZ, and every request already
    arrives through Cloudflare — the SPA is a Pages project whose Function proxies
    /v1/* to API_ORIGIN, and the ALB security group admits only Cloudflare edge
    ranges. The load balancer is a second TLS termination inside an already-proxied
    path.

    Turning this ON also turns OFF the ALB target-group attachment (`attach_alb`),
    because a task served by a tunnel must not simultaneously be an ALB target: the
    target group would health-check a port the tunnel already owns, and traffic could
    arrive by two paths with different TLS termination.

    REQUIRES `tunnel-token` in the environment's secret bundle — the connector token
    from `cloudflared`. Absent, the sidecar is not produced and the api would have NO
    ingress at all, so this variable and that secret must move together.

    WHAT IS GIVEN UP: ALB access logs, the option of an origin-side AWS WAF, and the
    per-target-group CloudWatch alarms. `monitor_target_health` in particular has no
    equivalent — production/main.tf calls it "the only alarm that catches an outage
    producing no load to move CPU, latency or 5xx" — so external monitoring (a
    Cloudflare health check or synthetic probe) has to replace it before this is

    Let Terraform own the tunnel's INGRESS RULES (the public hostname → local service

    WHY THIS IS OPT-IN RATHER THAN THE DEFAULT. A tunnel with no ingress rule is inert:
    it connects, reports healthy, and 503s every request — which is exactly how rally
    production went live. But turning routing on for a tunnel that is ALREADY SERVING is
    the dangerous direction: Cloudflare's tunnel-configuration API is a whole-document
    PUT, so a partial rule set silently discards anything the live configuration holds
    that this file does not reproduce, and `config_src` FORCES REPLACEMENT — a new UUID,
    a new CNAME target and a new connector token, i.e. an outage plus a secret rotation
    the running task only picks up on its next deployment.

    So the safe order is: adopt with this false (what develop still does, its rules
    created out of band on 2026-08-02), and switch it on per environment when that
    environment can absorb a replacement. Production could, on 2026-08-18, precisely
    because it was serving nothing yet.

    Requires `api_domain` — the hostname the rule is written for. `app_port` is the local
    service the connector forwards to, so the two cannot drift from what the task runs.

    Create the Route 53 health check + us-east-1 alarm that probe the public api
    hostname from outside AWS. Only meaningful when `tunnel_enabled` — with an ALB
    that job belongs to `monitor_target_health`.

    THE ZERO-TASK CASE IS NOW HANDLED FOR YOU, so this variable is only for an
    environment that IS serving and still does not want the probe. `local.monitor_ingress`
    also requires `!local.environment_idle`, so an environment whose service floors are 0
    creates no check at all — the same rule this stack already applies to the load alarms.
    Raising the floors re-arms it in the same change, rather than leaving a note asking
    someone to remember.

    That matters because a health check against a hostname with no tasks behind it sits in
    ALARM permanently: it pages for a condition that IS the intended state, which trains the
    reader to ignore the one alarm that replaces every ALB target-group alarm — and it bills
    every month for that non-signal. develop was in exactly that position: floors of 0, an
    idle schedule taking it to zero tasks nightly and all weekend, and this variable unset so
    it took the `true` default.

    ON COST, stated correctly. This creates ONE health check on a non-AWS endpoint, one
    CloudWatch alarm, and an SNS topic that bills nothing until it publishes. The check runs
    with `measure_latency = false` and no string match, so NO optional-feature charge applies
    — only the base rate. An earlier version of this text quoted "$2.70/mo per check ($0.75
    base + $2.00 for the string-match/latency option)", which charged for two options the
    resource disables and inflated the figure by roughly 3.5x. Deciding against monitoring on
    a wrong number is worse than the number.

    A tunnelled environment has NO other ingress alarm — ECS reports a task RUNNING whether
    or not cloudflared holds edge connections — so setting this false on an environment that
    IS serving means an ingress outage is visible only when a user reports it.

    an x86 runner multiplies build minutes by enough to outweigh the Fargate saving.

    NOT EVERY PRODUCT CAN TAKE THIS. It depends on every image in the task having an
    arm64 build — including sidecars. rally qualifies: the app is `node:alpine`
    (multi-arch), and both sidecars publish arm64 (`cloudflare/cloudflared` and
