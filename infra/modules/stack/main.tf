  //
  // That restraint is the whole point. Cloudflare's tunnel-configuration API is a
  // whole-document PUT, so writing a partial rule set silently discards anything the
  // live configuration holds that this file does not reproduce — against a tunnel that
  // is currently carrying traffic, on a hostname nobody has compared rule-by-rule.
  //
  // config_src is left UNSET, because that is what rally's tunnels actually have. The
  // first plan of this change proved it, and proved why it matters:
  //
  //   + config_src = "cloudflare" # forces replacement
  //
  // Writing the attribute would have destroyed and recreated a tunnel currently serving
  // rally-api-dev.qnsc.vn — new UUID, new CNAME target, new connector token. The plan is
  // the only place that was visible before it happened.
  //
  // STEP TWO IS NOW AVAILABLE, PER ENVIRONMENT, via `tunnel_routing_managed`.
  //
  // What forced it: production went live on 2026-08-18 with a tunnel that had no ingress
  // rule, so `cloudflared` connected, reported healthy and returned 503 to every request
  // — `No ingress rules were defined in provided config (if any) nor from the cli`. The
  // post-deploy readiness check caught it, but nothing in the pipeline could have created
  // the rule, because rally adopted its tunnels and left routing outside Terraform. That
  // is a step someone has to remember, and on production nobody did.
  //
  // Still OPT-IN, and still off for develop, because the configuration API is a
  // whole-document PUT: develop's live rule set has never been compared rule-by-rule, and
  // production's holds nothing but the catch-all 503 this change exists to replace.
  //
  // `config_src` IS PINNED TO "" — unset — in BOTH environments, and it has to be passed
  // explicitly, because the module's own DEFAULT is "cloudflare". Omitting the argument is
  // therefore NOT the same as leaving the attribute alone: a plan on this branch, with the
  // argument deleted, proposed replacing BOTH tunnels for exactly the reason quoted above.
  //
  // It is not needed either. The attribute only tells the connector where to READ routing
  // from, and both tunnels already read it from Cloudflare; writing the ingress rule is
  // the whole job. So the two halves are deliberately independent: `tunnel_routing_managed`
  // decides whether Terraform writes the RULE, and nothing decides to rewrite the TUNNEL.
  //
  // `hostname` is the api domain and `service` is the app port, so the rule cannot drift
  // from the task it forwards to — the module writes a catch-all `http_status:404` after
  // it, which Cloudflare requires as the last rule.

# SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for every threshold that appears BOTH as an alert
# condition (module.alerts, below) and as a visible line on the dashboard
# (grafana_dashboard.overview, further below). Defined once, here, so the
# two can never silently drift apart — a dashboard line at a different
# number than the alert that's supposed to explain it is worse than no
# line at all: it tells the reader the wrong thing is "the bad number".
#
# PER-ENVIRONMENT, deliberately — a pre-prod audit finding, fixed before
# prod ever got its own rules: production is STRICTER than develop.
# Develop traffic is synthetic/low-stakes; the same 5% error rate that's a
# shrug there is a real incident against paying customers in production.
# Zero infra cost — pure config, the free lever to pull before spending
# money on anything else (see qnsc-infra/live/observability's own
# retention-tier note for the one lever that DOES cost money).
#
# TWO OF THE KEYS BELOW ARE NOT THRESHOLDS ON A SYMPTOM. They are preconditions
# on whether the symptom can be measured at all, and they were added after a
# production page that turned out to be pure sampling noise:
#
#   min_samples_5m — the number of samples a five-minute window must hold before
#     a percentile or a ratio over that window is a statistic rather than a
#     restatement of one request. Composed into four of the rules in
#     module.alerts below; the full reasoning, with the measured request counts,
#     is in the comment above that module block.
#
#   slow_request_bucket_ms — the histogram bucket boundary that
#     http-slow-request-count treats as the line between "normal" and "slow".
#     Unlike every other number in this block it is NOT free to choose: it is
#     matched as a string against the `le` label of an exported series, so a
#     value that is not a real bucket boundary matches nothing and the rule
#     silently reports zero slow requests forever. The legal values are
#     local.http_duration_boundaries_ms below, and
#     terraform_data.slow_request_bucket_is_real at the bottom of this file
#     fails the plan on anything else rather than letting it pass review.

  # more: those stop at 10000, and the same change that added this gate widened the
  # view (`httpDurationBoundaries` on startOtel) precisely because the top finite
  # bucket is where a p99 goes to hide. The first fifteen entries are still the SDK
  # defaults, so the low end a healthy p99 near 48ms lives in is unchanged; the five
  # above 10000 exist to separate a 12-second request from a request that spent the
  # STORAGE preset's whole retry budget.
  #
  # Written out here rather than left implicit because two separate defects came out
  # of nobody being able to see this list. First, the top finite bucket is 10000, so
  # histogram_quantile CLAMPS at 10000 and the production page that opened this work
  # reported `A=10000` — which is not "the p99 was ten seconds", it is "at least one
  # request took longer than ten seconds and the histogram cannot say how much
  # longer". Second, an `le` filter is a STRING match on a label, so picking a
  # plausible-looking number that is not in this list (2000, say) produces a query
  # that matches no series and therefore never alerts, with nothing in a plan or a
  # dashboard to show it is dead.
  #
  # CHANGING THE SDK'S VIEW INVALIDATES THIS LIST, and this file cannot tell that it
  # happened — terraform_data.slow_request_bucket_is_real checks
  # slow_request_bucket_ms against THIS list, not against what the exporter is
  # actually sending, so a boundary edited in apps/api/src/otel.ts and not here makes
  # the precondition assert against a set nobody exports. Both lists move together or

# ALONGSIDE CloudWatch Alarms (monitor_target_health below), not replacing it —
# CloudWatch stays on infra-level signals it can see directly; this covers
# only what CloudWatch cannot: application-level telemetry. Dormant until
# var.grafana_alerting_auth is set (count, not a no-op module — see that
# variable's own description for why count and not the usual empty-string
# no-op pattern).
#
# Every promql below scopes to THIS environment explicitly
# (deployment_environment_name), deliberately NOT to `service_namespace`/
# product — this module's own philosophy (see its README) is that a query
# is used verbatim, no hidden label injection, so a rule scoped wrong here
# is a bug in THIS file, not in the module.
#
# ── VOLUME GATE: why four of these queries end in `and on() (... >= N)` ───────
#
# A PERCENTILE OVER A HANDFUL OF SAMPLES IS NOT A PERCENTILE, and neither is a
# ratio. Production paged on `rally-production-http-p99-latency` with a value of
# A=10000 and resolved at A=48.5. Neither number described the service:
#
#   * 10000 is not a latency at all. It was the largest finite bucket boundary of
#     the OpenTelemetry JS DEFAULT histogram, which is what this service exported
#     at the time, so histogram_quantile clamped there. All it meant is "at least
#     one request exceeded 10s, upper bound unknown". The same change that added
#     this gate widened the view out to 180000 (local.http_duration_boundaries_ms
#     above, mirroring apps/api/src/otel.ts), so a repeat of that page now reports
#     a bucket that distinguishes 12s from a full retry budget — but the clamp is
#     a property of the top bucket, not of 10000, and it still applies there.
#   * With production's measured load — "4, 1, 0, 1 requests a day", documented in
#     ../../live/prod/main.tf's instance-class note — and health probes excluded
#     from the histogram by IGNORED_REQUEST_PATHS/SKIP_LOG_PREFIXES, a 5-minute
#     window holds roughly 0-2 real samples. A p99 over one sample IS that sample.
#     The alert fired on one slow request and cleared on the next one.
#
# THIS ORGANISATION ALREADY DIAGNOSED AND FIXED THIS EXACT DEFECT ON THE
# CLOUDWATCH SIDE. The alb_latency alarm in tf-modules//modules/observability
# carries the same finding in its own words — "On a pre-launch or low-traffic
# environment (measured: 0-6 requests per 5-minute period) p95 IS effectively the
# second-slowest single request, so ONE slow request held the alarm over the
# threshold for three consecutive periods and paged. That is noise that trains
# people to ignore the alarm, which is worse than no alarm" — and it grew a
# request-volume gate (thresholds.alb_latency_min_requests, default 50). The
# Grafana rules in this file never got the same gate. One bug, two sides, one side
# fixed. This closes the other side, at the same floor.
#
# THE GATE IS COMPOSED HERE, IN THE QUERY, NOT ADDED TO THE SHARED MODULE. Adding
# a `min_samples` field to observability-alerts would mean the module rewriting
# arbitrary caller PromQL, which is precisely the hidden magic both its README and
# the paragraph above rule it out for: "String surgery on arbitrary PromQL to
# inject a label filter is exactly the kind of hidden magic that silently breaks
# on a query shape nobody tested." The gate needs a DIFFERENT denominator series
# per rule (http_server_requests_total, job_runs_total, auth_login_total) and a
# window that matches the rule's own, so it is exactly the kind of decision that
# has to be made by the query's author.
#
# MECHANISM. `X and on() (gate)` is the standard scalar-gate idiom: `on()` matches
# on the EMPTY label set, so every sample on the left is joined against the single
# sample on the right, and a comparison between an instant vector and a scalar
# FILTERS rather than returning a boolean — so when the gate fails the right side
# is empty, `and` yields nothing, and the module's own `no_data_state = "OK"`
# reports that as OK instead of as a breach. `and` is a set operator, so no
# cardinality error is possible regardless of what the left side carries.
#
# The label sets were checked per rule rather than assumed, because `on()` is only
# correct if both sides are genuinely unlabelled:
#
#   * http-p99-latency — `sum(...) by (le)` is consumed by histogram_quantile,
#     which returns a vector with NO labels. `on()` joins.
#   * the three ratio rules — `sum()` with no `by` collapses to no labels on both
#     numerator and denominator, and `vector(0)` is unlabelled too, so the
#     division is unlabelled. `on()` joins.
#
# No rule needed a different join form, so all four use the same one; had any of
# them kept labels through the aggregation, `on()` would have silently dropped to
# a no-match and the rule would never fire, which is why this was verified and not
# copied.
#
# `rate() * <window seconds>` converts a per-second rate back to an approximate
# COUNT over the window, which is the unit min_samples_5m is expressed in. It is
# approximate — rate() extrapolates at window edges — and that is fine: this is a
# floor separating "no data to speak of" from "enough to judge", not a quantity
# anyone acts on.
#
# WHAT THE GATE COSTS. Below the floor these four rules go silent, and silence
# then means "not enough samples to judge", not "healthy". That is a real loss and
# it is not left uncovered: http-slow-request-count below is a COUNT rather than a
# percentile, so it stays meaningful at one request per hour, and the runbooks say
# plainly what the silence means.

# screenshot: develop and prod are separate Terraform ROOT MODULES with

# independently created its OWN "Rally" folder the moment prod applied for
# the first time — two real, separate top-level folders with the same
# title, each holding only that environment's own dashboards. Made worse
# by `dashboards_folder_uid` (the PARENT folder) never actually being
# backfilled from its "" default, so neither copy was even nested where
# intended.
#
# Fixed by creating it ONCE, centrally, in qnsc-infra/live/observability
# (`grafana_folder.rally_dashboards`) — same fix as `alerts_folder_uid`
# already being a plain resource reference there, not a var that can be
# left unset. `var.grafana_alerting.product_dashboards_folder_uid` below
# is that folder's real UID.

# TWO dashboards, not one growing page — the RED/USE split enterprise
# on-call practice uses: "is something wrong" (Overview, golden signals)

# ── Database credentials — master vs least-privilege ──────────────────────────
# Today api, worker AND migrator all connect as the RDS master, which owns every
# table: an ordinary HTTP request runs with rights to DROP the schema it reads,
# and any row-level policy would be skipped, because Postgres exempts a table's
# owner from RLS unless FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY is also set. That exemption is
# what made the RLS layer in migration 0005 inert, and it is the audit's top
# finding in the drop-multi-tenant design doc.
#
# Migration 0068 creates rova_app / rova_worker with DML rights only. Flipping
# `db_least_privilege` per environment points the two runtime tasks at them. The
# MIGRATOR deliberately stays on master — it needs DDL, and narrowing it means
# transferring schema ownership, which is a separate and more disruptive step.
#
# Both branches keep the same shape the RDS-managed secret established: nothing
# is a hand-maintained copy, and the app composes the URL from parts. The only
# difference is that the username stops being a secret field — `rova_app` is not
# a credential — so it moves to plain env alongside host/port/name.

  # apply — and `ecs-service` uses `length(var.secret_arns)` in a `count`, so an unknown
  # LENGTH fails the plan outright with "Invalid count argument". The contents may be
  # unknown at plan time; the length may not.
  #
  # Constructing the ARNs from names keeps the length static (a function of

  # wildcard — which is how the AWS docs themselves recommend writing a secret ARN in an
  # IAM policy when the suffix is not known.

  # `secret_iam_arns`, NOT `secret_arns`: this is an IAM resource list. The two outputs

  # built from those matches NOTHING while still applying cleanly. The failure surfaces
  # at the next task start as "unable to pull secrets", long after the apply reported

  # The apply that introduced the secret succeeded and wired the sidecar to it, so
  # nothing failed until the next task START — which then could not, the circuit breaker
  # rolled back, and develop sat on a stale image while reporting healthy. The worker
  # deployed normally throughout, which is what isolates the cause: it has no sidecar.
  #
  # qnsc-kb-backend already does this.
  #
  # THE SPLAT IS LOAD-BEARING — do not "clean this up" into
  # `module.tunnel_api.secret_arns`, which is the sidecar's own declaration of the same
  # thing and looks strictly better. It was tried here and broke `plan` for prod:
  #

  #     "execution_secrets": count = length(var.secret_arns) + ... > 0 ? 1 : 0

  #
  # tunnel-agent gates that output on `enabled = var.tunnel_token_secret_arn != ""`, and

  # attribute — so the comparison is unknown, the returned list's LENGTH is unknown, and a

  # every other threshold in the module defaults to a value already correct here, which
  # is why `thresholds` was previously not passed. These two default to 0 (= alarm not
  # created) because a correct floor is a function of the INSTANCE CLASS, which the
  # module cannot see, so the caller running burstable has to state its own.
  #
  # BOTH ENVIRONMENTS get the same numbers, and that is deliberate rather than an
  # oversight of the per-env pattern used elsewhere in this file: develop and production
  # both run db.t4g.micro (../../live/develop/main.tf and ../../live/prod/main.tf), so
  # the sizing input is identical. Nor do these two need the `environment_idle`
  # treatment the load alarms get — an idled or stopped instance publishes no datapoint,
  # which lands in INSUFFICIENT_DATA rather than in ALARM, and an idle burstable
  # instance sits at its credit ceiling by definition.
  #
  # THE PAGE THAT MOTIVATED THIS. ../../live/prod/main.tf chose db.t4g.micro over small
  # on measured evidence and named its own expiry conditions in the same breath: "RAISE
  # IT ON THIS SIGNAL, and it is the first thing to raise: CPUCreditBalance trending to
  # zero, or FreeableMemory under ~100 MB". That instruction had no alarm behind it, so
  # the documented first-thing-to-check was a thing a human had to remember to go and
  # look at. The p99-latency page that opened this work is the downstream symptom those
  # two metrics would have explained hours earlier.
  #
  # rds_cpu_credit_min = 72. Same file: the instance "earns 12 CPU credits/hour at a 10%
  # baseline", so its accrual ceiling is 24 hours' worth, 288 credits. 72 is a quarter of
  # that ceiling and six hours of baseline accrual. Sized for USEFUL WARNING TIME rather
  # than for a round number: at a sustained 40% CPU across the two vCPUs the instance
  # spends ~48 credits/hour against 12 earned, a net drain of ~36/hour, so 72 credits is
  # roughly two hours of notice before the balance reaches zero and the instance is
  # pinned at baseline. That is comfortably more than the remedy needs — the same file
  # calls the instance-class change "one line and a ~2-minute reboot — no snapshot, no
  # endpoint change, reversible". Rejected a floor near zero (it fires when the
  # degradation has already started, which is what the p99 alert was already doing) and
  # a floor near the ceiling (normal burst-then-refill behaviour would page nightly).
  #
  # rds_freeable_memory_mb = 100. Taken VERBATIM from the "FreeableMemory under ~100 MB"
  # line above rather than rounded to a tidier figure, specifically so the alarm and the
  # runbook that sends people to it cannot disagree about the number — the same rule
  # local.alert_thresholds_by_env is built on. On a 1 GB instance it is ~10% remaining,

# ── Ingress health, from OUTSIDE AWS ─────────────────────────────────────────
# ONLY created when the api is tunnelled, and it exists to replace something real.
#
# With an ALB, `monitor_target_health` watched UnHealthyHostCount — described in
# ../../live/prod/main.tf as "the only alarm that catches an outage producing no load
# to move CPU, latency or 5xx". A tunnelled task has no target group, so that alarm
# cannot exist, and nothing else on the AWS side observes ingress at all:
#
#   - ECS reports the task RUNNING whether or not cloudflared holds edge connections.
#   - `essential = true` on the sidecar catches the connector CRASHING, not the
#     connector staying up with zero edge connections.
#   - An ECS healthCheck cannot probe it either: the cloudflared image is distroless,
#     so there is no shell for a CMD-SHELL probe (see the tunnel-agent module).
#
# A Route 53 health check probes the PUBLIC hostname from outside AWS, so it exercises
# the whole path a user takes — Cloudflare edge, tunnel, connector, app — rather than
# any single component's opinion of itself. $0.50/mo.
#
# Deliberately checks /v1/healthz, not /v1/readyz: readyz touches postgres and valkey,
# so a database blip would page as an ingress outage. Dependency health is already
# covered by the RDS and fail-open alarms.
#
# `monitor_ingress` is the second gate, and it is what lets a PRE-LAUNCH environment stay
# tunnelled without paying for a check that can only ever be red. Production runs zero
# tasks, so this probe sat in ALARM continuously from the day it was created — paying, every
# minute, to be told about the state the environment is deliberately in.
#
# Both gates are required: `tunnel_enabled` says the ALB alarm cannot do this job,
# `monitor_ingress` says there is something running worth watching.

#
# That means this stack now depends on `ecs-service` naming its log group
# `/ecs/<cluster>-<service>`. A `check` block is evaluated AFTER the resources it
# references, so it can assert the coupling without recreating the cycle. If a

# into a group nobody reads. See the mechanism note below for why this is a resource

# ENFORCED as a resource precondition, not a `check` block. A violated check emits
# `Warning: Check block assertion failed` and the plan EXITS 0 — measured on OpenTofu 1.12.3
# — so the comment above, which promised "a loud failure instead", described something that
# did not happen. A silent collector logging into a group nobody reads was exactly the

# The trap is specific and easy to fall into: develop's http_p99_latency_ms is 2000,

# this is the only way to stop an idled environment paying for one. But a task that
# cannot reach its cache does NOT fail loudly: `env.schema.ts` defaults REDIS_URL to
# localhost, and both the token denylist and the rate limiter FAIL OPEN when Valkey is
# unreachable. So the dangerous state is not "no cache" — it is "no cache, tasks
# running", which degrades two security controls silently.
#
# Enforced by a `validation` block on `var.cache` in variables.tf. It WAS a `check` here,
# and the comment claimed it made the combination "impossible to reach through Terraform:
# the plan fails". That was false — a violated check warns and the plan exits 0 — so the
# state that silently degrades two security controls would have applied cleanly. Waking an
# idled environment is one coherent change: cache back on, floors back to 1.


# Scale the services to zero on the same cadence as the database stop.
#
# `desired_count` is under `ignore_changes` in the ecs-service module, so setting it
# out of band is the sanctioned, non-drifting mechanism — which is why this uses
# ecs:UpdateService rather than an autoscaling scheduled action. A scheduled action
# would mutate the scalable target's min/max, and `aws_appautoscaling_target` has no
# `ignore_changes` on those, so every plan would show drift and any apply during the

# ── Guard: waking an environment that never idles is a cost increase ──────────
# `wake_schedule` with no `idle_schedule` produces an environment that is started on a
# cron and never stopped by anything — strictly worse than not scheduling it at all,
# because it also looks deliberate. The reverse IS legitimate (production idles before
# go-live and is woken only by a release), so this is asserted in one direction only.


# ── Guard: a cache-less environment must not be woken ─────────────────────────
# The mirror of `idled_environment_runs_no_tasks` above. That check stops an idled
# environment from RUNNING tasks without a cache; this one stops a schedule being
# created that would START them. Without it the two settings are individually valid
# and jointly produce the exact state the other check exists to prevent — tasks up,
# no cache, REDIS_URL falling back to localhost, denylist and rate limiter failing
# open — except on a timer, at 08:00, with nobody watching.


# ── Outbound email: the permission half ───────────────────────────────────────
#
# The IDENTITY is created once in `infra/live/_shared` (per account+region, and both environments
# share both). What belongs here is the runtime grant: without `ses:SendEmail` on the task role, every
# send fails with AccessDenied before the sender is even looked at — which is what both environments
# did, while `EMAIL_PROVIDER=ses` and `MAIL_FROM_EMAIL` sat correctly configured beside it. Three
# failures then opened the app's in-process email circuit breaker and the API kept reporting healthy,
# so invitations and notifications were silently dead.
#
# The shared `ecs-service` module takes no policy input, so this attaches to the role it outputs.
# `split("/", arn)[1]` is the same idiom `infra/live/_shared` already uses for the deploy-role guards.
#
# SCOPED TWO WAYS, because a bare `ses:SendEmail` on `"*"` would let a compromised task send as any
# verified identity in the account — including prod's — from either environment:
#   • `Resource` is this account's identity for the sender's own domain, so develop cannot send
#     through an identity it does not share;
#   • `ses:FromAddress` pins the envelope sender to `MAIL_FROM_EMAIL` exactly, so the grant cannot be
#     used to impersonate another address on the same domain.
# The ARN is CONSTRUCTED rather than read from the shared state on purpose: IAM happily references a
# resource that does not exist yet, so the two applies can run in either order and the permission
# simply starts working once the identity is verified. A remote-state dependency would make this
# stack fail until `_shared` had been applied.

# ── SES asynchronous feedback, PER ENVIRONMENT ───────────────────────────────
#
# The loop's whole point is that a verdict lands on the row that sent it, in the
# DATABASE that sent it — so the queue an environment drains must be its own. The
# first cut of this lived in _shared with one config set, topic and queue for both
# environments, and both workers long-polled that one queue: whichever polled first
# consumed the event, and when it was the other environment's worker the verdict
# logged "matched no sent row" in one database while the sending row stayed bare in
# the other. Observed live twice on 2026-08-21. The SES IDENTITY above this comment
# stays shared — it is one-per-account-and-region — but a configuration set is an
# ordinary named resource and each environment owns its own chain end to end.
#
# EXPAND FIRST: the shared chain is removed from _shared in the change AFTER this
# one deploys (the repo's own #394 rule — removing infrastructure running code still
# uses needs the deploy first). Until then both chains exist and the workers, on
# their new task definitions, use only their own.
#
# The queue policy is the delivery half: aws_sns_topic_subscription confirms the
# subscription, but each published event is a separate cross-service call that SQS
# authorizes against this policy — without it every verdict dies between the two
# services while every metric reads green. Also diagnosed live, same day.
