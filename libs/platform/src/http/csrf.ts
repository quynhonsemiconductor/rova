 * rova, the `__Host-rova_session` cookie. So the check applies exactly when all
 * of the following hold:
 *
 *  1. the method can change state;
 *  2. the request is NOT Bearer-authenticated — a caller that must attach a token
 *     by hand cannot be made to do so by an attacker's page, so requiring a second
 *     token would only break machine clients;
 *  3. a session cookie is actually present — with no ambient credential there is
 *     nothing to forge;
 *  4. the route is not one of the deliberate {@link EXEMPT_PATHS}.
 *
 * Kept a pure function of the request so the policy is unit-testable and lives in
 * one place, rather than being spread across route decorators where an omission
 * is invisible.
