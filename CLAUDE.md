# Rally — working notes

Conventions that already exist in this repo but are easy to miss, plus the
non-obvious tooling behaviour. Read this before changing build, auth, or DB code.

## Local stack

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d   # postgres + valkey + localstack
pnpm db:migrate                                  # applies migrations AND seeds
pnpm start:dev                                   # API with watch
pnpm --filter rova-web dev                      # SPA (proxies /v1 → API)
```

## Commands

Backend commands run from the repo root (the backend IS the root package); the SPA is the
only pnpm workspace member, so it is reached with `--filter rova-web`.

```bash
export NODE_AUTH_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)"   # @quynhonsemiconductor/* live on GitHub Packages (read:packages)
pnpm install                                # root (backend) + apps/web

pnpm build                                  # nest build api + worker
pnpm build:web                              # tsc -b && vite build
pnpm lint                                   # {apps/api,apps/worker,libs,db}/**/*.ts — run this, not path-scoped eslint
pnpm typecheck                              # tsc --noEmit (use `tsc -b --force` for cross-package changes)

pnpm test                                   # backend unit (vitest)
pnpm test:cov                               # coverage — floors are a ratchet, see below
pnpm test:e2e                               # backend e2e (test/vitest.e2e.config.ts) — resets the DB
pnpm --filter rova-web test                # SPA unit (vitest + testing-library)
pnpm --filter rova-web test:e2e            # Playwright
```

One test / one case:

```bash
pnpm vitest run libs/modules/work-items/src/application/work-items.service.spec.ts
pnpm vitest run -t "refuses a cross-project move"
pnpm vitest run --config test/vitest.e2e.config.ts test/e2e/editor-team-scope.e2e.spec.ts
pnpm --filter rova-web exec vitest run src/pages/portfolio/portfolio-page.test.tsx
pnpm --filter rova-web exec playwright test golden-journey --headed
```

Database:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate            # migrations + bootstrap seed (see the seeding note below)
pnpm db:seed               # demo fixtures on top
pnpm db:seed:test          # RESETS, then seeds fixtures — run after a BE e2e run, before Playwright
pnpm db:studio             # drizzle-kit studio
pnpm --filter rova-web codegen   # regenerate the API client from a RUNNING local API
```

Ordering that bites: a BE e2e run truncates at its START and leaves debris, Playwright and a manual
session both die under that truncation, and `codegen` needs a freshly restarted API. All three are
expanded in the section below.

## Architecture

Four deployables from one repo, sharing `libs/` and `db/`:

- **`apps/api`** — NestJS 11 on Fastify. Thin: it composes modules from `libs/modules/*` and owns
  bootstrap (CSP, Swagger opt-in, the global exception filter that maps `@platform` domain
  exceptions to HTTP).
- **`apps/worker`** — a second Nest app over the same modules. It owns the CRON and RELAY loops:
  the report snapshot job (`cron/`), the email relay, the Entra guest-invite relay, the notification
  outbox, audit and SCM. Anything periodic or outbox-draining lives here, never in the API — and a
  running worker is a competing consumer of the same outbox tables the BE e2e suite waits on.
- **`apps/web`** — React 19 + Vite SPA in Feature-Sliced Design (`app / pages / widgets / features /
entities / shared`). Its API client is GENERATED from `/api/docs-json` and COMMITTED. Browser auth is
  BFF: the SPA holds no tokens and talks to `apps/web/functions/v1/[[path]].ts` (a Cloudflare Pages
  Function) which proxies to the API with an opaque session cookie.
- **`db/`** — Drizzle schema, hand-written migrations, seeds, and `permissions.catalog.ts`. It ships
  as its own migrator image, which is why the catalogue lives outside `libs/`.

**A domain module is four layers**, and the direction is inward
(`libs/modules/<name>/src/{interface,application,domain,infrastructure}`):

| layer            | holds                                                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `interface/http` | controllers, `@RequirePermission`, zod DTOs (the OpenAPI shape) |
| `application`    | services — business rules, transactions, cache invalidation     |
| `domain/ports`   | repository interfaces the service depends on                    |
| `infrastructure` | Drizzle implementations of those ports                          |

Cross-module code goes to `libs/shared-kernel` (pure domain types, the permission re-export),
`libs/platform` (config/env schema, HTTP concerns, CSRF, observability façades) or `libs/contracts`.
Modules import each other by ALIAS (`@modules/access`), never by relative path — and deep-import when
a barrel would close a cycle (`WorkspaceService` → `ApiTokensService`).

**Three facts decide most backend changes**, each detailed in its own section below:

1. `libs/modules/access` is the single authorization decision point — `PolicyGuard` plus
   `AccessService` (`listReadableProjectIds`, `resolveTeamScope`, `assertTeamInScope`). No other
   module may re-implement a scope rule.
2. Permissions come from the DATABASE on every check, never from the token, and a new permission
   code needs a backfill migration as well as a catalogue entry.
3. Test gates are RATCHETS, not targets — coverage floors, route-policy counts, FE consistency,
   e2e fixture counts. They may only move one way, and they must be re-measured when raised.

## Tooling behaviour that surprises people

- **`pnpm db:migrate` also seeds.** It runs the tenant bootstrap seed, not just
  migrations. `pnpm db:seed` runs the full demo seed on top. Both are idempotent.
- **Migrations are hand-written.** `drizzle-kit generate` needs a TTY and cannot
  run unattended, so `db/migrations/*.sql` are authored by hand and must match
  `db/schema/*`. CI proves a new migration applies on top of `main`'s schema, not
  just a fresh database — see the `migrations` job in `backend-ci.yml`.

  **Applying a HIGHER-numbered migration first strands the lower one on that database, silently.**
  Drizzle records the journal's `when` as `created_at` and applies only entries past the newest
  recorded value, so if `0120` is applied while `0119` is still being written, `pnpm db:migrate`
  afterwards reports "Migrations applied" and `0119` never runs — its table simply does not exist.
  Fresh databases and CI are fine, because the journal's array order is still ascending; this bites the
  local database you are testing on, which is the one you would trust. Two ways in: writing two
  migrations in parallel (do not — one at a time, even across parallel work), or a `when` that is not
  strictly greater than its predecessor's. Verify with
  `select count(*) from drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` against the journal's entry count; recover by
  applying the stranded file by hand or recreating the database. (Two historical pairs — 0005/0006 and
  0018/0019 — have non-ascending `when` values and ARE applied, so a non-monotonic journal is not by
  itself proof of a skip; count the rows.)
- **`db/permissions.catalog.ts` is the single source of truth** for permission
  codes and role→permission mappings, imported via the `@db/*` path. It lives
  outside `libs/` because the standalone migrator image ships `db/**` only.
  `libs/shared-kernel/src/permissions.ts` re-exports it; two specs
  (`permissions.spec.ts`, `fe-permission-contract.spec.ts`) stop BE and FE drifting.
- **The built entrypoint is genuinely `dist/apps/api/apps/api/src/main.js`.** Nest
  emits one output tree whose common root is the repo root and rewrites path
  aliases to relative requires, so the nesting is what makes those resolve. Don't
  "fix" it — flattening breaks every emitted import.
- **Swagger is opt-in per environment.** `SWAGGER_ENABLED` (default `false`) serves
  `/api/docs`. It used to be derived from `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`, so anything
  not literally "production" published the endpoint inventory. CSP is now always on;
  the Swagger allowance is scoped to `scriptSrc` when that flag is set.
- **Coverage is a ratchet, not a target.** `vitest.config.ts` lists the files that
  have specs; `test/coverage-include.spec.ts` fails if a spec's subject is missing
  from that list or if the list names a deleted file. Raise the floors, never lower.
  **Re-measure when you raise them.** The floors sat ~11 points under real coverage for two phases
  (70/66/62/70 against 82/77/81/83), so a ten-point regression would have passed — a ratchet that
  trails that far measures nothing. Same for `fe-consistency.ratchet.test.ts`: four of its six
  baselines had drifted below their true counts, so 39 new violations could have landed green. Measure
  by forcing the baselines to `-1` and reading the counts the failures report — a grep alongside gets
  it wrong (mine said 8 for `text-[` where the real count is 2).
- **`ProjectScopeResolver`'s `work_item` kind spans TWO tables.** Tasks left `work_items` for
  `work.tasks` at the Phase 3 split (migration 0072), but the ROUTES did not split with them —
  `PATCH /work-items/:id`, `/:id/activity`, `/:id/attachments`, `/:id/watchers` and
  `PATCH /team-status/tasks/:taskId` all take a TASK's own id. The resolver mapped the kind to
  `work_items` alone, so the guard threw `WORK_ITEM_NOT_FOUND` for every task id before the handler
  ran, as a Workspace Admin, regardless of permission. A Task was uneditable everywhere, its Revision
  History permanently empty and its attachments unreachable — four Phase 1 contracts dead on one line
  of table mapping. It now falls back to `work.tasks` on a miss, mirroring
  `WorkItemDrizzleRepository.findById`, whose own docblock already described that fallback as what
  task surfaces depend on. **Adding a `task` resource kind would NOT have worked**: the routes are
  shared, so one kind has to cover both tables.
- **A spec that calls a service directly cannot see a guard defect.** Every task spec called
  `WorkItemsService` and the whole suite passed over the fault above for as long as it existed. Same
  blind spot that hid the `report:view` bug. `test/e2e/task-routes.e2e.spec.ts` and
  `report-authz.e2e.spec.ts` are the shape that catches it: real `AppModule`, `app.inject()`, a Bearer
  token from `AuthService.devLogin` (Bearer callers are CSRF-exempt by design, so no token dance).
- **A decorator-counting ratchet is not an authorization test.** `route-policy.ratchet.spec.ts` reads
  source text, so it cannot tell a correct `@RequirePermission` from a misspelled code or a
  project-tier code whose scope resolves from the wrong field. `test/e2e/report-authz.e2e.spec.ts` is
  the shape that does: real `AppModule`, `app.inject()`, both directions. Three things it had to learn
  the hard way — the test app has **no `/v1` prefix** and **no cookie plugin** (`reply.setCookie is
not a function`, so use `AuthService.devLogin` for a bearer token), the **ValidationPipe runs before
  the guard** (an incomplete query is a 400 and never reaches authorization), and a JIT-provisioned SSO
  user is **not** a denied principal — `assignDefaultRole` grants `project_member`, which the BA gives
  `report:view`. Use a seeded user with custom roles for the negative case.
- **The grids are DIVs, so `aria-sort` and `role="columnheader"` are deliberately absent.** They are
  only meaningful on a real `columnheader`, and `DataTableFrame` renders a scroll container while each
  page renders its own rows — adding the role to the header alone would announce a one-row table,
  which is worse than no table semantics. `SortHeader` carries the state in its accessible name
  instead ("Rank, sorted ascending. Activate to sort."), which is true regardless of the surrounding
  structure. It is also a real `<button>` now: it was a `div` with `onClick`, so sorting — a
  documented feature on every grid in the app — was pointer-only.
- **Rank reorder needs a KEYBOARD sensor AND a focusable grip — both, or neither works.**
  `KeyboardSensor` appeared nowhere in the SPA, and `DragHandle` was a `div`, so reorder was
  pointer-only on Backlog, Iteration Status, Quality and Portfolio. Adding the sensor alone would not
  have helped: dnd-kit activates from the ACTIVATOR's `onKeyDown`, and dnd-kit's `attributes` (which
  carry `role="button"` and `tabIndex`) were spread on the ROW while `listeners` were on the grip — so
  focus landed on one node and the key handler lived on another. `attributes` now go on the grip
  alongside `listeners` (which also stops every row announcing as a button with its own tab stop), and
  `useRerankSensors()` is the one shared sensor set. Backlog and Iteration Status previously hand-rolled
  `useSensors(useSensor(PointerSensor…))`, which is exactly why they diverged — there was no single
  place to add the keyboard sensor. Capacity Planning's grip already did this correctly and was the
  model.
- **`EMPTY_VALUE` (`'--'`) is the only placeholder for an absent value**, per its own docblock ("not an
  em-dash, because that is what real Rally renders"). 15 em-dash literals had drifted back in, two of
  them colliding *within one screen* — Portfolio detail rendered `'--'` in the sidebar beside `'—'` in
  both children tables. When replacing these, note that the string also appears in prose comments; a
  blind find-and-replace edits those too.
- **The frontend has ratchets too** (`apps/web/src/test/fe-consistency.ratchet.test.ts`):
  raw `<button>`, inline styles, hardcoded copy, file length, and CSRF headers on
  raw `fetch` writes. They may only decrease.
- **The SPA's API client is generated AND committed.** `apps/web/src/shared/api/generated/api.ts`
  comes from `/api/docs-json`, so any DTO change needs
  `pnpm --filter rova-web codegen` against a running local API, then a commit. The
  `OpenAPI contract` job regenerates from the spec it captured and diffs
  (`codegen:check`), so drift fails CI instead of failing at runtime.

  **`/api/docs-json` can serve a STALE document from a watch-mode restart.** Nest builds the Swagger
  document once at bootstrap, so `pnpm start:dev` recompiling is not the same thing as the served spec
  being current — it reported `Found 0 errors`, answered on the port, and still described the DTO as it
  was before the last edit. Codegen then wrote a client that was *correct for a spec nobody has*, and
  the only symptom was one absent field: `git diff` on the client was EMPTY, which reads exactly like
  "no DTO change was needed". **Grep the served spec for a marker before trusting a generated client**
  (`curl -s localhost:3000/api/docs-json | grep <newField>`), and restart the API rather than relying
  on the watcher. Worth also knowing the diff is legitimately huge when the module graph changes:
  `openapi-typescript` emits in spec order, which follows module init order, so adding one module
  import reordered ~1200 lines with no route added or removed. Compare route INVENTORIES, not the line
  count, to tell that apart from a real loss — and regenerate twice across a restart if you need to
  prove the order is deterministic, because a nondeterministic one would flake `codegen:check`.
- **`waitFor() timed out` in `notification-flow.e2e.spec.ts` is an ENVIRONMENT fault, not a flake.**
  Two independent causes, both seen in one session:
  1. **Email is unconfigured.** `.env` ships `EMAIL_PROVIDER=ses`, but `MAIL_FROM_EMAIL` is
     `.optional()` in `env.schema.ts` despite its own comment saying "Required when
     EMAIL_PROVIDER != 'dev'". Unset, `resolveFromEmail` returns `''`, every send fails with
     `Email address not verified "Mini Rally" <>`, and after three failures the email circuit
     breaker opens and stays open for the process — so the relay never delivers and the test waits
     out its 10s. Set `MAIL_FROM_EMAIL` and verify it in localstack:
     `docker exec -i rova-localstack awslocal ses verify-email-identity --email-address <addr>`.
     (The breaker is in-process, so restarting the API clears it; the failed rows are not retried
     and can be deleted.)
  2. **A live worker is a competing consumer** of `messaging.notification_outbox` and claims the
     rows the test is waiting for. Stop `pnpm start:dev:worker` before a BE e2e run.
     Neither is a product defect, and both look exactly like one. Check
     `docker ps` first: localstack dying mid-session produces the same symptom.
- **Run `pnpm lint`, not path-scoped `eslint`.** CI lints `{apps/api,apps/worker,libs,db}/**/*.ts` in one
  pass; linting only the paths you touched misses rules that fire elsewhere in that glob — and
  `no-unused-vars` exempts `^_` for ARGUMENTS only, not for destructured variables, so the
  `const { X: _unused, ...rest }` idiom is an error here. That combination put a lint failure on `main`.
- **`tsc -b` can pass on STALE build info.** Two things hid behind that in one session: an
  error code missing from the `ErrorCode` union, and a client that had never seen a new
  route (which surfaces only as `Cannot POST /v1/...` in the browser). When a change spans
  packages, verify with `tsc -b --force`.

## Fixtures: two projects, one reset, no leaks

**The seed produces EXACTLY two projects, and that is load-bearing.** `SEEDED.nxp` carries the depth —
three iterations (finished / active / future), two releases, an Epic with seven Features, a draft AND a
published capacity plan, frozen Burndown + burnup history, SCM links, attachments, notifications.
`SEEDED.pay` mirrors every entity TYPE with one row each, so anything needing a _second_ project
(isolation, permission scoping, cross-project refusals, "another release") has one waiting. Both are
exported from `test/e2e/support/flow-harness.ts`.

- **`pnpm db:seed:test` RESETS before seeding**, via `db/seeds/reset.ts`. The BE e2e suite does the same
  once per run (`test/e2e/support/global-setup.ts`, one shared table list). `E2E_SKIP_RESET=true` opts
  out when bisecting.
- **The reset is on the fixture ENTRYPOINT, never inside `seed()`.** `db/migrate.ts` calls `seed()` when
  `SEED_ON_DEPLOY` is set, and truncating a deployed database because a migration ran would be
  catastrophic.
- **Why a reset and not idempotent upserts.** The fixtures use fixed UUIDs with `onConflictDoNothing`,
  which survives a re-run but not a database other things wrote to. **Item keys are unique per
  WORKSPACE** (`uq_portfolio_item_key`, `uq_work_item_key`), not per project, and tests mint them from
  `workspace_item_counters` — so a leftover `US-3` makes the fixture's `US-3` conflict and vanish
  SILENTLY. That happened twice while this was written: once `EP-1`/`FE-1` took an entire project's
  portfolio with them, surfacing three steps later as a foreign-key error on an allocation.
- **A seeded key must also advance the counter**, or the app mints it again and collides on the next
  create.
- **Do NOT run the BE e2e suite while Playwright or a manual session is live.** The reset truncates
  under them. Eight Playwright specs failed at ~21s each exactly that way.
- **And run `pnpm db:seed:test` AFTER a BE e2e run, before Playwright.** The reset is at the START of
  the BE run, so the suite leaves all 303 tests' debris behind — hundreds of extra projects,
  iterations and teams. `golden-journey.e2e.ts` then failed on the Add Item step (the modal stays open
  because the server refused the create), and it reproduced on a clean checkout with the changes
  stashed, so it is the database and not the diff. `pnpm db:seed:test` cleared it. Stash-and-rerun is
  the cheap way to tell the two apart before hunting a phantom regression.
- **The e2e suite used to leak ~84 projects per run with no teardown anywhere** — 37 files, every
  `afterAll` closing the app and cleaning nothing. Twice that pushed `portfolio_items.rank`
  (`varchar(255)`, extended by appending) to exactly 255 characters at ~1,900 items, after which every
  insert failed with `value too long for type character varying(255)` and the suite could not run at
  all. `test/e2e-fixtures.ratchet.spec.ts` caps the `createProject` count so it can only fall.
- **Playwright is per-SURFACE journeys, not per-page smoke checks.** Six files holding one or two
  assertions each — and each paying a full login — were merged into the surface they belong to. A test
  named "header, tabs and shared Artifacts tab render" is a smoke check; the merged spec walks list → ID
  column → detail → tabs in one navigation.

## Reporting (Phase 6) — what is frozen, what is live

Four surfaces share one module (`libs/modules/reporting`) but not one data strategy, and the
difference is the whole design. Read this before changing a report or the snapshot job.

- **Burndown is FROZEN history; Velocity and Team Capacity are LIVE queries.** Task To Do is
  overwritten in place, so yesterday's remaining hours only exist if something wrote them
  down — hence `iteration_daily_snapshots`. Velocity deliberately has no snapshot: moving an
  item out of a closed iteration must change that bar. Never "unify" the two paths.
- **The snapshot cron runs HOURLY and writes only TODAY's workspace-local date.** Date cutoffs
  are per workspace (`workspace_settings.timezone`), so one UTC-midnight tick is wrong for
  every workspace that is not on UTC — which is what it used to do. The value that survives a
  day is the last tick before that workspace's midnight; when the local date rolls over the
  day stops being addressed and is marked `finalized`. A missed day stays a GAP: the report
  renders it unavailable, and `buildFallbackSnapshots`-style interpolation is prohibited.
- **`work_items.accepted_date` is maintained by a TRIGGER** (`trg_sync_accepted_date`,
  migration 0087), not by the service: `db/seeds/**` and raw SQL write this table directly,
  and an Accepted row with no acceptance timestamp is a data-quality error the reports refuse
  to guess about. The trigger never invents a date for a row that was already accepted before
  0087 — those stay NULL and Velocity reports them as `unclassified`. Verified by experiment:
  `accepted` sets it, `release` RETAINS it (accepted-equivalent), reopening clears it, and a
  later re-acceptance writes a fresh, later timestamp. Velocity SRS §3 gives DEV a backfill for the
  pre-0087 rows and `pnpm db:backfill:accepted-date` (`--dry-run` to report only) is it: the date comes
  from the LATEST `work_item.schedule_state_changed` activity row into an accepted state — latest, not
  earliest, because an item can be accepted, reopened and accepted again. It refuses to touch a row that
  already has a timestamp, and a row with no such history is REPORTED and left NULL rather than dated on
  no evidence.
- **The timebox says WHICH window; the WORK says whose it is.** `iterations.team_id` is optional
  here (real Rally collapses project and team, we do not), so a project may run one shared sprint
  every team works inside — 195 of 206 local iterations name no team. Filtering reports on
  `iterations.team_id` therefore returned NOTHING for a selected Team while Team Status showed the
  hours, and Velocity, which had no team predicate on the work at all, credited every point in a
  timebox to whatever team the timebox named. A team-scoped report now takes the team's own
  iterations **plus the shared ones** (`teamOrSharedTimebox`) and narrows the numbers per row by
  `coalesce(item.team_id, iteration.team_id)` — the same two-tier rule `getScopedTaskHours` and
  Team Status already used. An unknown `teamId` is a 404, never relabelled `All Teams`.
- **Nothing keeps `work_items.team_id` and its iteration's team in step by itself.**
  `assertIterationAssignable` refuses the pair with `ITERATION_TEAM_MISMATCH`, but the update path
  only checked it when the patch mentioned an iteration — so moving an item to another team left it
  parked in the old team's sprint, in two steps instead of one. A team change now revalidates the
  iteration the item already sits in. Seeds bypass the service entirely, which is how `US-D2` came
  to be Team Beta's story inside Team Alpha's Sprint 26.1.
- **`iterations.timebox_group_id` is how All Teams fuses per-Team iterations.** It is DERIVED
  from (project, start, end) — `timeboxGroupIdFor()`, migration 0088 and the trigger added in 0093
  share one expression, pinned by a spec — and computed ONCE, so a later date edit cannot split a
  historical bar. The approved mockup shows the failure this prevents: two adjacent velocity
  bars both labelled 25.1. It is maintained by a **trigger** because the service was demonstrably
  not the only writer: `create` set it, `update` omitted it, and `db/seeds/**` inserts dated
  iterations directly — 40 rows had dates and no group, three of them sharing a window with four
  that were grouped, so each became its own bar.
- **The Ideal BASELINE is per TEAM too, and All Teams is the SUM** (`iteration_team_baselines`,
  migration 0098). Two different rules for two different quantities, both stated by IB §4: the
  snapshot rows' `team_id IS NULL` is a MEASURED All Teams row that is never summed, while here
  `team_id IS NULL` means "work whose team cannot be resolved" and every row IS summed for All Teams.
  Migration 0093 gave the rows a team dimension and left the baseline as one column on `iterations`, so
  a team-scoped chart drew the WHOLE PROJECT's Ideal against one team's bars — and because §6 compares
  `remainingToDo(d)` with `ideal(d)`, the indicator read "On track" for a team that had burned nothing
  and could not read "Behind plan" until a team exceeded every other team's estimate as well. Capture
  groups by the same `coalesce(task, parent, iteration)` team the hours are measured with, so the
  baseline and its bars can never be scoped differently. The release Ideal target got the same
  treatment in migration 0099 (`release_team_targets`), which also DROPPED
  `releases.ideal_target_points` / `_count` — so a note here claiming that target "still has this
  defect" is stale, and it named two columns that no longer exist. Both quantities are now per-team.
- **The snapshot job only writes INSIDE the timebox window.** `findActiveIterations` selects on
  `state = 'committed'` and nothing else, and committing early is legal — so an iteration committed
  before it started had its *immutable* baseline captured at commit time, commonly zero because tasks
  are broken down after commitment. A captured `0` is the trap: it is not null, so it passes every "no
  baseline" check, `idealLine(0, N)` returns zeros, the `noBaseline` note stays hidden, and a flat zero
  line is drawn as a measured plan. The release loop always had this guard; the iteration loop now does
  too.
- **Eligibility must be counted in the SAME scope as the measurement.** Velocity's eligibility join
  carried no team predicate while `getVelocityItems` narrowed by `coalesce(item, iteration)`, so a
  shared timebox became an eligible bar for a team whose work was then filtered out of it — a
  zero-point bar for a sprint the team never worked in, dividing Trend, Last 3, Best 3 and Worst 3.
  `countScheduledWork` had the mirror image: counted project-wide, a team with nothing in a shared
  sprint was told its snapshot history was missing. Both now take the scope.
- **A LIVE fact must not outrank FROZEN history.** `hasScheduledWork` is a live count and the series is
  frozen, so a rolled-over iteration reported `historyState: 'complete'` with a full recorded series
  and the screen replaced it with "no scheduled work". §5 makes only MISSING SNAPSHOTS unavailable, so
  the live emptiness is consulted last. Same mistake as the missing-baseline one, in a different place.
- **Burndown history carries a TEAM** (`iteration_daily_snapshots.team_id`, migration 0093).
  `team_id IS NULL` is the All Teams row and every scope is MEASURED independently — the All Teams
  row is never the sum of the team rows, or a task two teams both touch counts twice. Frozen
  history cannot be re-sliced on read, so without the column a team-scoped Burndown simply could
  not be served; a read picks exactly one series (team rows, or the All Teams row), never both.
  Team rows begin at 0093, so a team-scoped chart of older history is an honest gap.
- **In Release Tracking, a team-agnostic row counts inside EVERY scope** — `inScope` admits
  `teamId === null` under a selected Team, not just under All Teams. This is NOT the
  `coalesce(item, iteration)` two-tier rule used elsewhere: a release owns no timebox, so there is no
  second tier to fall back to, and the strict `team_id = ?` it replaced dropped the ordinary case
  (`portfolio_items.team_id` and `work_items.team_id` are both nullable and mostly unset). The
  per-Team totals therefore do not sum to All Teams, which is already this report's contract.
  **The predicate is shared by the live report and by `ReportSnapshotService` on purpose** — one rule
  for a measurement and for its own eligibility, the property whose absence caused the zero-point
  Velocity bars. The cost of that sharing is that changing the rule changes what the FROZEN writer
  records, and two things follow, both of which a future rule change must handle again:
  `release_team_targets` is captured once per (release, team) with `onConflictDoNothing`, so already
  captured targets keep the OLD population and the Ideal line sits permanently below its own bars —
  migration 0116 deletes the team rows (never the All Teams row, whose population did not move) so the
  next tick re-takes them under the same rule that measures the bars. And `release_daily_snapshots`
  team rows written before 0116 measured the narrower population: an honest series break, recorded
  here exactly like "team rows begin at 0093" above, never interpolated away.
- **`GET /releases/:id/burndown` is gone** (with the Release detail progress panel and seven DTO
  fields). It answered "how far along is this release?" from the same `release_daily_snapshots` rows as
  Release Tracking but under a different definition — All Teams only, no scope control, no Ideal — so
  two surfaces gave one release two numbers. FR-037 puts release progress in
  `Portfolio > Release Tracking`; Phase 3 Release list/detail must not add a progress column or widget.
  Do not re-add a progress reader here.

  **The `Task Roll-up` + `Accepted` panel went with it, on the BA's 2026-08-17 retest.** It had been
  kept — and at one point re-added on real-Rally grounds, which is where a note here claiming the panel
  "is back" came from — because FR-018 was once read as putting those numbers in the right panel. The
  BA re-confirmed `GAP-P3-REL-001` as a **Fail**: FR-018 and AC #10 now list the panel's fields
  exhaustively (Start Date, Release Date, Project, State, Planned Velocity, Plan Estimate, Version),
  FR-023 forbids "Task Roll-up, Burndown or another Release progress widget", FR-024 puts
  accepted/progress totals in `Portfolio > Release Tracking` alone, and `P3-REL-DC-009` is Decided.
  Real Rally shows a roll-up there; the BA report wins. **The API still SERVES `taskRollup`** — the
  BA's own §7.4 detail DTO carries it, and its `estimateHours` is the list's `taskEstimate` column
  (FR-004) — so this is a display rule, not a contract change: the SPA's `Release` mirror does not
  declare the field, which is what stops a Phase 3 screen rendering it again.
- **The Phase 6 snapshot tables now have foreign keys.** `iteration_daily_snapshots` and
  `member_capacity` had NONE (verified against `pg_constraint`). Orphan snapshots happened to be
  unreachable through the API — deleting an iteration is blocked unless it is still `planning`, and
  only `committed` iterations are snapshotted — but orphaned `member_capacity` rows were reachable,
  and Team Capacity inner-joins `teams`/`users`, so an orphan row DROPS out and the Capacity total
  quietly falls while Estimate/ToDo/Actual stay. "Unreachable today" is a coincidence of two
  unrelated rules, not an invariant.
- **`workspace_settings.working_days`** (ISO 1–7, default Mon–Fri) is the Burndown x-axis and
  the Ideal line's index. The Ideal line is indexed by WORKING day and reaches zero on the
  last one; the mockup interpolates over calendar days and never reaches zero — the SRS wins.
- **`release_daily_snapshots.team_id IS NULL` is the All Teams row, and it is MEASURED, not
  summed** from the Team rows: a work item two Teams both touch must be counted once. Points
  and count live on the same row because `Chart Unit` is a display switch over one population.
- **An absent number renders `EMPTY_VALUE` (`--`), never `0`.** `data` is `undefined` both while a
  request is in flight and after it fails, so `?? 0` turns a network fault into a measured claim:
  Release Tracking showed three large zeros ("this release has no Features") and Team Capacity four
  `0h` cards ("this team planned nothing") — the latter directly ABOVE its own error message, because
  the error branch sat on the table and the KPI strip is above it. `ReportSurface` now takes an `error`
  slot so the strip and the body go absent together; a report that passes it must also render its
  `strip` in the absent state, since the strip is the caller's node. Velocity never read `isError` at
  all and rendered §6's own sentence "no completed iteration with scheduled work exists" for a 500.
  The KPI row stays MOUNTED through all of this — the BA's structure-preserving rule — which is exactly
  why the values cannot be coerced.
- Report series colours are `--report-*` tokens (both themes) in `globals.css`, exposed via
  `BRAND.report*`. They are data colours fixed by the BA, deliberately not `primary`.
- **A chart must pass `dataTable` to `ChartFrame`, and the SVG is `aria-hidden`.** A recharts plot is
  paths plus loose `<text>` nodes, so assistive tech reads a pile of numbers in painting order with
  nothing to say which series or which day any belongs to — and these reports ARE their values. The
  frame renders the caller's own row array as a visually hidden `<table>` instead (`sr-only`, never
  `display:none`), which is why the two cannot disagree. `null` renders as the caller's `noDataLabel`;
  a gap stays a gap here too.
- **`ChartFrame.underAxis` is for a SECOND axis row, not a footer.** The burnup's iteration band is
  part of the x-axis (RT §7, RT-AC-09: "X-axis shows dates and a secondary iteration-name row"). From
  `footer` it rendered below the legend strip and up to two history notes — ~90px from the dates it
  labels — where it reads as a third summary block.
- **`teamName === null` is `All Teams`, and it is the DEFAULT scope.** All four surfaces printed
  `teamName ?? ''`, so the scope a reader sees FIRST rendered as "NextGen Platform - " and "Team: ".
  Use `teamScopeLabel` / `reportScopeLabel` (`features/reporting/scope.ts`); the term is `All Teams`
  per every Phase 6 §6/§7, even though `capacity.json` and `settings.json` spell it "All teams".
- **A team-scoped iteration PICKER must offer the team's own timeboxes plus the shared ones**
  (`iterationsInScope`) — the client half of `teamOrSharedTimebox`. Do not pass `teamId` to
  `useIterations` for this: that filter is a strict `team_id = ?` and drops exactly the shared
  iterations the report measures, because SQL equality never matches NULL. `listAssignmentOptions`
  already had the OR-NULL form; the list endpoint does not.
- **An iteration is assignable by SCOPE, never by LIFECYCLE.** `listAssignmentOptions` filtered on
  `state IN ('planning','committed')` while the write path — `assertIterationAssignable`, over a
  `findIterationScope` row that selects `project_id` and `team_id` and no state — accepted a closed
  timebox happily. So the eligibility feed withheld a target the API allows, and that made HALF of
  Velocity's own rule unreachable: points follow an item's CURRENT iteration (Velocity SRS §4, the
  contract's §5.2), so moving a Story out of a finished sprint correctly moved the bar and no
  selector could ever put it back (P6-VEL-004). The predicate is gone; the team/iteration mismatch
  rule and `TASK_ITERATION_DERIVED` are untouched. Two consequences worth knowing: the two compact
  feeds now differ only in PROJECTION (`/iterations/options` also returns `teamId`), kept as two
  routes because the questions are still two and the SPA client is generated-and-committed; and the
  Rollover modal's destination picker still hides accepted iterations client-side, which is a
  deliberate lifecycle choice on `Plan > Timeboxes` ("move unfinished work forward") and NOT the same
  rule — if the BA rules on it, that filter is the one line to change.
- **`historyState` describes SNAPSHOTS only.** Both burndown and burnup once folded "no Ideal
  baseline" into that enum, which made a missing baseline discard measured bars that had really
  been recorded — IB §3 scopes the baseline to the Ideal LINE, and §5 makes only missing
  snapshots unavailable. The baseline is now reported separately
  (`totalTaskEstimateAtStart` / `idealTarget`, null when absent) and a fourth state `no-window`
  covers an iteration or release with no dates. That state exists because the alternative was a
  500: the service had nothing but `''` to pass, `'' < ''` slipped past the inverted-range guard
  in `workingDaysBetween`, and `addDays('')` threw `RangeError`.
- **`releases.ideal_target_points` / `_count` are captured ONCE, by the snapshot job**, on a
  release's first snapshot day, from the then-current planned scope — the same `IS NULL`-guarded
  capture as the iteration baseline, and for the same reason (RT-BR-09): an Ideal derived from
  today's Planned value silently redraws every past day whenever scope changes. Before this
  nothing wrote those columns at all, so the Ideal line could never be drawn for any release.
- **A sparse series needs DOTS, not just lines.** `connectNulls={false}` is right — a bridged gap
  is a fabrication — but a line segment needs two adjacent points, so a measured day between two
  gaps drew zero pixels and a young release rendered an empty grid beside populated totals. Give
  a dot an explicit `fill`: recharts fills dots white by default and draws the series colour as
  the ring, so `{ r: 2, strokeWidth: 0 }` alone is twelve invisible dots on a white card.
- **The demo seed writes frozen report history** (`seedReportHistory` in `db/seeds/demo.ts`).
  Both seeded timeboxes are in the past and the cron only ever writes TODAY, so without it every
  Phase 6 chart shows its empty state on a fresh database. The rows deliberately include a GAP,
  weekend audit rows and a sparse burnup — production must never fabricate history, a dev seed
  must, and those shapes are the ones worth being able to see.

## Team Status and Team Capacity are ONE population

The Team Capacity SRS says it twice — the scoped Task set comes from "the Task's PARENT Story/Defect
Project, Team and Iteration assignment", and Capacity "must use the same source/table/API domain as
`Track > Team Status`". Three things had them disagreeing, all now pinned by
`test/e2e/team-status-agreement.e2e.spec.ts`:

- **The team predicate is three-tier on BOTH sides**: `coalesce(task.team_id, parent.team_id,
iteration.team_id)`. Team Status used a strict `tasks.team_id = ?`, and a task's team only DEFAULTS
  to its parent's (SRS P1-04) — so a Story that carries the team while its task does not is an ordinary
  shape, and SQL equality never matches NULL. Those tasks vanished from Team Status while Team Capacity
  counted them. The reporting file's comment already claimed parity; it was true of the
  iteration-membership half and false of the team half.
- **A soft delete does not cascade to `work.tasks`** (the FK is `ON DELETE cascade`, which a soft
  delete never fires). Team Status LEFT-joined the parent, so orphaned tasks were still counted with a
  blank Work Product column, while Iteration Status and the Phase 6 projection inner-join and exclude
  them. Both surfaces now inner-join.
- **`member_capacity` is unique on `(project_id, team_id, iteration_id, user_id)`**, so a member on two
  teams has two legitimate rows in one iteration. `getCapacities` filtered on iteration + user only and
  collapsed into a `Map<userId, hours>` — last row won, non-deterministically, and `upsertCapacity`
  re-resolves its team from the iteration, so an edit could overwrite a different team's number than
  the one displayed. It now takes the team key and SUMs per member (under All Teams, where the screen
  groups by MEMBER, the total of their per-team allocations is the honest answer).

**Editing Estimate on Team Status must send `estimateHours` ALONE.** It used to also set `todoHours`
whenever the caller had not, which defined the field before `WorkItemsService` saw it and so bypassed
the once-only gate (`input.todoHours === undefined && item.todoHours === null`) — the copy then
happened on every estimate edit, re-inflating a completed task's auto-zeroed To Do and moving the
Iteration Status total, the Tasks-tab total and the next Burndown snapshot with it. The rule lives in
the service; the other two edit surfaces already did this correctly, and this screen's own UI comment
described the behaviour it did not have.

## A Team roster is staffed FROM the project, and the Workspace Admin is a row on it

Two BA findings of 2026-08-21, and both reverse a sentence that is still in the SRS. Read which
sentence before touching either.

- **A team member must already hold access to one of the team's projects** (`TEAM_MEMBER_NOT_PROJECT_MEMBER`,
  `TeamService.addTeamMember`). The Add-member control was an inline popover over every active
  WORKSPACE user, so on a project with no members of its own it still offered all four workspace users
  — "users who do not belong to Project X are exposed as Team member candidates". It is an `Add` button
  and a `SelectionModal` now, and the candidates are the project's members plus active Workspace
  Admins, minus the existing roster.
  - **This REVERSES Phase 1 SRS §2A's "User project access is derived from team membership", and the
    BA has since finished the reversal.** `PM-FR-021` (`c42df59`, 2026-08-22) states it outright:
    "Adding or removing a Team member never creates or changes Project Access." So **RBE-06 IS
    RETIRED** — `grantTeamRosterProjectAccess` and `teamRosterAccessLevel` are gone, from all three
    writes (create, edit, add-member), and the team form no longer sets an access level at all
    ("Project Access is read-only in this flow"). Access comes first, then membership; the candidate
    rule is what guarantees a member already has it.
  - **Nothing is invalidated by a roster write any more.** The assignment cache is keyed on
    `project_members`, which these writes no longer touch, and team SCOPE is read live from
    `team_members` (`AccessService.listScopedTeamIds`) rather than from the cache.
  - **A TEAM LEAD IS ENROLLED, not refused.** `PM-FR-021`/AC15 say a lead "must be an active Team
    member", and the same commit's addendum states it as an identity — "an active Team Lead is an
    operational Team member". Refusing would make "create a team with a lead" impossible in one call,
    which the BA's own E2E-002 journey does, so `leadInclusiveRoster` adds the lead to the roster on
    create and on any patch that moves either side. The lead still passes the candidate rule; enrolment
    is not a way around it. The SPA offers only ticked/rostered members as lead.
  - **A WORKSPACE ADMIN is admitted with no project row at all**, by the `isWorkspaceAdmin`
    short-circuit. §2.1 keeps them off `work.project_members`, so a membership test would exclude
    exactly the principals the 2026-08-20 feature below exists for.
  - **The check is against ANY actively linked project, not every one.** A team can serve several and
    `POST /teams/:id/members` carries no project, so "every" would make a multi-project team almost
    unstaffable. A team with NO active link admits any active workspace member: there is no project to
    be outside of.
- **Project `Users & Permissions` always shows the active Workspace Admins**, as synthesized read-only
  rows (`ProjectsService.listProjectMembers`, `isWorkspaceAdmin` on the row). The screen used to read
  "No members in this project yet." on a project whose only authority was a WA — the least true
  sentence available, since the reader was usually that admin.
  - **This reverses §5.2:138 "Workspace Admin is excluded from rows and candidates" — the ROWS half
    only.** Candidates still exclude them (`Add Existing User`, `listProjectMemberOptions`), nothing is
    written to `work.project_members`, and `memberCount` counts the table so it does not move.
  - **The real row is still filtered first**, so a pre-0118 leftover or a seed-written row cannot
    appear as an editable member beside the system row. The person shows once.
  - **`isWorkspaceAdmin` is the flag to branch on, never `accessLevel === null`** — a null level
    already means "team-derived row" on a real member.
  - **`useProjectMembers` drops those rows and `useProjectAccessRoster` keeps them.** One query key,
    two projections: six other call sites (two owner pickers among them) were written against real
    members and §2.1 still says a WA is not one.

## A Workspace Admin may be a TEAM member, and still not a Project user

BA feature, 2026-08-20. This REVERSES half of §2.1 and leaves the other half standing, so read which
half before touching either.

- **Team membership is operational scope.** Adding a Workspace Admin to a Team writes the
  `team_members` row and NOTHING else: `grantTeamRosterProjectAccess` runs with
  `onWorkspaceAdmin: 'skip'`, so RBE-06's `editor` grant — the rule that gives every other roster row
  project access — does not fire for them. Their authority already comes from the workspace-wide
  grant, which is why the AC is a claim about what is ABSENT after the write, and why it is asserted
  over real HTTP in `test/e2e/workspace-admin-team-membership.e2e.spec.ts` rather than against a
  mocked grant writer.
- **§2.1 still keeps them off `work.project_members`**, so `selectWorkspaceAdminUserIds` and the
  project-access candidate list (`projects-access-tab.tsx`) are unchanged. A blank access level on a
  team roster row is therefore ambiguous, and that is what the badge fixes: the roster carries
  `isWorkspaceAdmin` per row (`TeamService.listTeamMembersForReader`, one `AccessService`
  lookup per read, none for an empty roster) and the row renders `Workspace Admin` — never `Admin`
  or `Editor`, which would state the thing the rule forbids.
- **Nothing enrolls them automatically.** `createTeam` adds only the `memberUserIds` it is given, and
  `assertMembers` requires nothing but active workspace membership. Do not add a convenience that
  seeds every team with the admins.
- **They were already a valid Project Owner** — `listMemberOptions` unions in `projects.lead_id`
  precisely because a WA holds no roster row — and a WA on the team is already offered as a Work Item
  Owner, because `listProjectMemberOptions`' team branch reads `team_members` and applies no admin
  filter. The SPA was the only thing withholding them: `project-teams-tab.tsx` filtered
  `roleSlug !== 'workspace_admin'` out of the Team Lead options and the member table.

## Dev Owner is a SECOND responsibility, on a Task as well as a Story

`work_items.dev_owner_id` has existed since Phase 3.4; `work.tasks.dev_owner_id` arrived with
migration 0127, and until then the API ACCEPTED a `devOwnerId` on a task and dropped it silently —
the worst of the three possible behaviours. BA `c42df59` (2026-08-22) makes the field first-class:
`P2-BL-FR-012A`, `P2-IS-FR-032B`, `WID-FR-016` and `P4-NOTIF-DC-012`.

- **Rally has NO Dev Owner field at all** — not on a Task, not on a User Story (verified against
  Broadcom's own field references). One `Owner` per artifact, and a second responsibility would be a
  CUSTOM field there. So there is no parity to check here: the BA's spec IS the design.
- **Same candidate source as Owner, independent persistence.** Both fields read
  `assignmentCandidates` and both are validated by `assertAssignable`; a Dev Owner patch never
  writes `assigneeId`, which is the one thing the BA states twice ("must not reuse or overwrite").
- **`P4-NOTIF-DC-012` covers BOTH fields and Tasks**, so `notifyAssignment` takes the recipient rather
  than reading `item.assigneeId`, and the update path loops the two fields through one rule — a third
  responsibility later cannot pick up half the behaviour, which is how Dev Owner came to notify
  nobody. The RECIPIENT is the notification's discriminator, so one patch naming the same person as
  both Owner and Dev Owner tells them once.
- **Sorting by owner or Dev Owner is NOT implemented**, though the BA lists both in `sortBy`. The
  grids are keyset-paginated on `(column, id)` and a name lives on a JOINED table, so sorting by it
  means name-based keyset sorting for both fields — its own change. The alternative, sorting by the
  uuid, is what `COLUMN_SORT_FIELD`'s own comment already refuses.
- **`work.tasks` has no `dev_owner_id` FK**, matching `assignee_id` beside it: eligibility depends on
  the project AND the team, which no constraint can express, and a user delete must not cascade into
  delivery history.

## ONE assignment-eligibility rule, for Owner and for Dev Owner

`ProjectsService.assignmentCandidates` is the only expression of it, read by the picker feed
(`listProjectMemberOptions`) and by the write (`assertAssignable`, `WORK_ITEM_ASSIGNEE_NOT_ELIGIBLE`).
BA `c42df59` (2026-08-22) states it once and points both fields at it — `WID-FR-017`, `WIC-FR-006A`,
and the Project/Team assignment addendum:

| selected Team | offered |
|---|---|
| a Team | project `admin` (project-wide) + `editor` assigned to THAT team + Workspace Admin on its roster |
| none | project `admin` + Workspace Admin |

- **Two things it replaced, both visible on screen.** The team branch read `team_members` ALONE, so a
  project Admin who is not on the team was withheld even though §3.1 gives Admin All Teams. The
  project-wide branch offered every member, so with no Team chosen an Editor could be made Owner of
  work their own team scope would then refuse them.
- **The WRITE now applies it too.** It used to check only `assertWorkspaceMember` — orders of magnitude
  wider than the picker, so any user id in the body was accepted for work no picker would have offered.
  `reporterId` is deliberately OUTSIDE the rule: a reporter records who raised the item, not who may be
  given it.
- **The no-Team branch including Workspace Admins is a DECLARED READING.** `WIC-FR-006A` says "with
  blank Team, Editor/WA **Team members** are not offered", which reads as excluding the team-derived
  qualification rather than the principal — and team-less work IS the Project Backlog, whose audience
  the team-scope ruling already fixes at Workspace Admin plus Project Admin. Excluding them would also
  refuse the case the same commit encourages: a WA filing backlog work and being defaulted as its
  Owner. If the BA means the narrow reading, drop the second half of that branch and nothing else
  changes.
- **Owner defaults to the CURRENT USER when the feed offers them** (`WIC-FR-006`), which reverses
  `GAP-P1-WID-007`/P6-TC-007's "default to Unassigned" — and Rally agrees ("defaults to the user who
  creates the defect"). The gate is what makes it safe: the old defect seeded the creator
  UNCONDITIONALLY, which is how a Task inherited an owner nobody chose. The default is DERIVED, never
  stored — an effect writing it into state cascades renders, and it has to follow every Team change.
- **A fixture that assigns an owner now needs a Team** (or an admin). Four e2e specs had to change,
  and that is the rule working: `manage-filters`, `notification-flow`, `team-status-relation-render`
  and `project-delivery-flow` were all assigning an Editor to team-less work.

## An OFFER feed is scoped by the ROW's Team, and a grid that lacks the team asks the wrong question

Reported from Production 2026-08-21: on `Track > Iteration Status` the inline Owner AND Dev Owner
dropdowns showed nothing but `No Entry`, and an active Team member could not be assigned — the same
on Iteration Status' `Add Item`. Not a permission fault and not the naming fault above:

- **`assignmentCandidates` has two branches, and the no-Team one offers no Editors at all** — with a
  Team it is project `admin` + `editor` on THAT team + Workspace Admin on its roster; with no Team it
  is project `admin` + Workspace Admin (`WIC-FR-006A`). Iteration Status called
  `useProjectMemberOptions(projectId)` — **no team** — so every row got the no-Team list. On a project
  whose members are Editors, that list is empty, which renders as `No Entry` with nothing selectable.
- **The row could not have passed a team, because the read model did not carry one.** The
  iteration-status projection selected no `team_id` (added with this fix, plus DTO and a codegen
  round). The grid is the only place that knows which team a row belongs to, so the field is what
  makes the correct question askable.
- **`useTeamOwnerOptions` is the team-scoped feed and it fetches NOTHING without a team** — that is
  deliberate ("No Team offers only Unassigned"), which is exactly why silently falling back to the
  project-wide feed was worse than an empty list: it looked populated for admins and empty for the
  role that needed it.
- **Per ROW, not per screen** (`useTeamOwnerOptions(projectId, item.teamId ?? fallbackTeamId)`), the
  shape the Tasks tab already used. Rows sharing a team share one query key, so it is one request per
  distinct team on screen — and under `All Teams` each row still asks with its own team instead of the
  screen's.
- **The "intermittent" half of that report is the naming rule seen from the other side.** The row's
  own Owner still RESOLVED to a name out of the workspace directory, so the value appeared and
  vanished depending on which of the two lists a reader consulted. An offer list and a name source are
  two feeds; when a dropdown is empty but the cell shows a name, it is this.
- **`Portfolio > Feature > Children` had the same shape and is fixed too.** Its Story/Defect rows
  carry an `OwnerSelectCell`, and it was fed the project-wide list. That projection ALREADY selected
  `team_id` (it was added when the children rows became editable), so no server change was needed —
  only pointing the offers at `useTeamOwnerOptions(child.projectId, child.teamId)` and leaving the
  project-wide feed as the NAME source. Worth knowing for the next grid: check the projection before
  assuming a codegen round is needed.
- Pinned in `owner-name-resolution.e2e.spec.ts` (the read model carries the team) and
  `status-row.test.tsx` (the row asks the team-scoped hook).

## A row's VERB needs a row affordance

`P2-BL-FR-022` and Phase 2/01 §124 put Delete on the row — "Delete Defect | Row or detail action with
confirmation" — and the Backlog had neither for most of its life. The BA logged "cannot delete work
item in Backlog" twice, and both times the route was innocent
(`test/e2e/work-item-delete-route.e2e.spec.ts` deletes a story, a task and a story-with-children over
HTTP).

- **The bulk bar is not a row action.** It only appears once rows are SELECTED, so a reader looking at
  one row sees no verb at all. That is why the first investigation of this report fixed the bulk
  control's gate and its error text and the report came back.
- **`WorkItemRowActions` is the shared control**, not page-local: the same action belongs on Quality
  and Iteration Status when the BA rules on those grids, and a second copy is how two grids come to
  confirm differently. It renders NOTHING without `work_item:delete` — the menu holds one verb, so a
  disabled item would be a menu that only refuses.
- **It is a TRAILING cell, not a declared column.** An affordance must not be resizable, reorderable
  or — the reason that matters — HIDEABLE, since hiding it would take away the row's only verb.
  Revealed on `group-hover` like the drag grip AND on `focus-within`, or a keyboard reader could tab
  to a control they cannot see.
- **The confirmation is NAMED, not typed, and its copy says what survives.** The delete is soft and
  `P3-QA-FR-020` retains the child Tasks, attachments, comments and relations, so "this cannot be
  undone" was false; the typed gate stays reserved for the irreversible.

## A chevron must move in the direction its ICON points, not by index

`Track > Iteration Status`' iteration arrows were reversed: from KB Sprint 1 the LEFT chevron
advanced to KB Sprint 2 (Production, 2026-08-21). The handlers were `index - 1` and `index + 1`, and
the feed is ordered **newest first** (`desc(startDate)` server-side; `default-iteration.ts` says the
picker "shows newest first"), so `- 1` is the LATER sprint.

- **The signature was the fix, not the arithmetic.** `stepIndexInTime(index, 'earlier' | 'later',
  count)` names the direction IN TIME, so a caller cannot express "left" without saying what left
  means, and a later change to the feed's order breaks one tested expression instead of silently
  reversing two buttons.
- **The disabled state must come from the same mapping.** Both chevrons' `disabled`, cursor, colour
  and hover were computed from raw index comparisons *in the styling*, which is how a greyed-out arrow
  and the step it guards can disagree about which end of the list they are at. They read `hasEarlier`
  / `hasLater`, both derived from `stepIndexInTime`.
- The arrows had **no test at all**, which is why a newest-first feed reversed them unnoticed. They
  also had no accessible name; they are `Previous iteration` / `Next iteration` now.

## A NAME belongs to the ROW; a picker feed can never be its source

Reported 2026-08-22: an Editor read `No Entry` / `Unassigned` in Iteration Status' Owner and Dev Owner
columns for items that WERE assigned. Not a permission fault — the grids carried ids only and resolved
the name client-side from a PICKER feed, and every picker feed narrows on purpose:

- `GET /projects/:id/member-options` **excludes Workspace Admins** (AC-16: not assignable owners), so it
  can never name one — for ANY role.
- `GET /workspaces/:id/member-options` narrows a non-admin caller to the members and the `lead_id`s of
  their own readable projects (`listMemberOptions`).

A Workspace Admin holds no `work.project_members` row at all (§2.1, migration 0118), so an item they
own had no name source in either feed. **A Workspace Admin reader never saw it** because
`listReadableProjectIds` returns `null` — unrestricted — so their directory is the whole workspace; and
the seeded case hides it too, because every seeded project's `lead_id` IS the admin, which the
directory's second source picks up. Reproduce with an Editor whose projects name no admin as lead.

- **The read models join the name now** — `ownerNameJoins` in `WorkItemDrizzleRepository` (`listByProject`,
  `listBacklog`, `listTasksByParent`) and the iteration-status projection. Portfolio, Releases,
  Milestones and Quality already did this; work items were the last module resolving a name on the
  client, which is why they were the only ones with the bug.
- **The client prefers the row and keeps the feed as fallback.** `item.assigneeName ?? map lookup`, on
  Iteration Status, Backlog and the Tasks tab.
- **NAMING moved; OFFERING did not.** The feeds still narrow — `WID-FR-016`/AC-16 forbid widening an
  Owner dropdown to unrelated workspace users — and `owner-name-resolution.e2e.spec.ts` asserts both
  halves, so a later "simplification" that names from the offer list fails.
- **`work.tasks` has no `dev_owner_id`**, so a task's `devOwnerName` is null by construction, beside the
  id the projection already nulls.
- **Blank-name reports are usually this, not persistence.** An absent name and an unset field render
  identically, which is what made `GAP-P2-IS-004` look like a save that did not stick. Check whether the
  owner is a Workspace Admin before hunting the write path.

## The Owner feed: the TEAM roster decides, and a Team move re-decides it

`GAP-P1-WID-007` was a BA-confirmed P0-adjacent Fail on the 2026-08-17 retest — the Owner dropdown for
a Story that HAD a Team offered nothing but `Unassigned`, so no active Team member could be assigned.
Four things are now true, and each was a separate defect:

- **A Workspace Admin on the team roster IS an Owner option.** `listProjectMemberOptions` subtracted
  Workspace Admins from BOTH branches on the older AC-16 reading; its own docblock flagged that as a
  declared conflict needing a ruling, and the ruling came. The exclusion now applies only to the
  PROJECT-WIDE branch, where §2.1 and migration 0118 mean a WA holds no `project_members` row anyway.
  The retest ACs name exactly two exclusions — outside the selected Team, and inactive.
- **A Task's options follow its INHERITED parent Team.** `TASK-FR-017` scopes them to "the inherited
  parent Team", and `work.tasks.team_id` only DEFAULTS to the parent's (SRS P1-04) and is nullable — so
  reading the Task's own value alone offered `Unassigned` and nothing else on an ordinary row. The Tasks
  tab now passes `parentTeamId` and resolves `task.teamId ?? parentTeamId`. Note this is NOT the
  Iteration rule: the Iteration is contractually DERIVED, the Team is merely defaulted.
- **A NAME that fails to resolve is indistinguishable from an unset field**, which is what made
  `GAP-P2-IS-004` look like a persistence bug. Dev Owner saved correctly — proven over HTTP in
  `test/e2e/dev-owner-persistence.e2e.spec.ts`, which is also the first coverage `devOwnerId` ever had
  — and Iteration Status resolved the name from the project OFFER feed, so anyone absent from it read
  back as `No Entry` after a reload. Names come from the workspace directory
  (`GET /workspaces/:id/member-options`, which returns inactive members for exactly this reason) and
  OFFERS from the project/team feed. Two props, never one: widening the offer list would put every
  workspace user in an Owner dropdown, which `WID-FR-016` forbids.
- **A Team move resets an Owner the new Team does not contain**, in the SAME patch and on the SERVER
  (`resetOwnerOutsideTeam`). Conditional, not unconditional — the same person can be on both teams, and
  clearing them would discard a true value. Clearing the Team clears the Owner outright (AC6) without
  reading any roster. Server-side because every surface can move a Team, and a client would be deciding
  it from a roster it may not have fetched; membership is asked of the picker's own feed so the server
  cannot count a different population than the screen offers.

**The Owner default REVERSED, and this line used to say the opposite.** It read "the Owner is never
defaulted to the current user (AC7)… `Unassigned` is the default the BA states three times", which was
true until `WIC-FR-006` (BA `c42df59`, 2026-08-22): "Owner defaults to the authenticated current user
only when that user is eligible in the selected Project/Team. Otherwise it defaults to `Unassigned`.
User can always explicitly choose `Unassigned`/`No Entry`." Rally agrees, and `P1-WID-01` says the same.
Kept rather than deleted because the OLD rule's reason still governs the new one: `GAP-P1-WID-007` /
`P6-TC-007` was a real defect — the creator's id seeded UNCONDITIONALLY, so work arrived owned by
whoever opened the form and a Task inherited it, which is also the upstream cause of `GAP-P3-TS-008`'s
off-roster member group in Team Status. **The eligibility gate is what makes the reversal safe**, so a
future surface that defaults an Owner without asking its own candidate feed re-creates the defect
rather than following the rule.

`useDefaultOwner` (`shared/lib/hooks/use-default-owner.ts`) is the ONE implementation, and it exists
because four create surfaces answered this question four ways: two defaulted to nothing, and of the two
that defaulted, one wrote `ownerId || <default>` — where `Unassigned` is `''` and therefore falsy, so an
explicitly cleared Owner was handed straight back and the field could not be cleared at all. It tracks
the CHOICE, never the value, for exactly that reason. A create form asks the hook; it does not re-derive
the rule.

## Shared chrome: a layer rule, a width rule, and what a table actually is

Six reported UI defects on 2026-08-23 had four causes between them, and every one was a shared
component that had been copied rather than used. Recorded together because the SHAPE repeats: the
component existed, the call sites had each solved the problem locally, and the two that had not
copied the fix were the two that broke.

- **`AppPopoverContent` owns the z-index, and it is not cosmetic.** A portalled popover paints in
  document order, so with no layer of its own it loses to any later positioned sibling — and
  `DataTableHeader` is `sticky top-0 z-10`. Both Manage Filters menus (Backlog, Iteration Status)
  opened UNDER the grid header they hang over: mounted, focused and keyboard-operable, with their top
  rows painted behind it, which reads as a truncated menu rather than as a paint order. Every OTHER
  popover — `SearchableSelect`, `DateField`, `ColumnFieldsMenu`, the action menu, tooltips — had
  independently hardcoded `z-50` at its own call site, five copies of one decision. The floor now
  lives in the shared wrapper (a caller may still raise it), so a new popover cannot be born under
  the header.
- **A column's width must fit its HEADER, not just its content.** `Block` at 60px fitted its one
  status glyph and truncated its own five-letter label to `Bl...`; `Fixed In Build` did the same at
  100px. A sweep found 21 columns across 8 grids in that state, and the ones with a real margin were
  widened. Worth re-running when adding a column: the label is bold 12px plus a sort caret plus
  padding, so roughly `label.length * 6.9 + 32` px is the floor.
- **`grow: true` is NOT the fix for a cramped Name column, and would make it worse.** `styleFor`
  gives a grow column `minWidth: <current width>` as a floor it may expand PAST, and paired with the
  row's `min-w-max` that means the TABLE widens to fit a long title instead of the title wrapping
  inside its cell. Quality, Backlog, Iteration Status and the Portfolio children grid all opt out
  deliberately (`children-columns.ts` carries the reasoning); a fixed width is what lets `break-words`
  work. Quality's Name went 200 → 300 for that reason, not by adding `grow`.
- **`OwnerCell` centres, and clips only where asked.** It was `items-start`, chosen when a name fit
  one line — but a wrapped two-line name then hung below a top-pinned avatar, so the cell read as
  top-heavy beside every neighbouring cell. Wrapping is the ordinary case for a full name in a
  narrow column, not the exception. `truncate` is OPT-IN because the right answer is a property of
  the COLUMN: Home's 160px Owner column should wrap (the name is the whole value), while Quality
  renders two people per row and a wrapped name there doubled the height of every row in the grid.
- **A sorted column's LABEL is no longer coloured** — only its caret and its accessible name carry
  the state. `BRAND.primaryLight` on the active heading made it read as a different KIND of column
  rather than the same column in a state, and on a grid with a default sort (Timeboxes sorts Start
  Date) one blue heading sat among six grey ones before the reader had touched anything. Direction is
  still stated twice, so nothing was lost by not colouring the word: a colour never said WHICH WAY.
- **`PanelTable` is the small fixed-column table inside a dashboard CARD**, and it is deliberately
  NOT `DataTableFrame`. The frame owns a scroll region, resize, drag-reorder, Show-Fields, totals and
  pagination, and takes its widths from `useDataTable().colStyles`; a panel has none of that, so
  adopting it there means synthesising a `colStyles` map and an `onResize` for a table that can do
  neither. Home's two tables hand-rolled the same chrome twice instead. **Their shared defect was one
  missing `min-w-0`**: a flex item defaults to `min-width: auto`, so `flex-1` on the Project Name
  column could not shrink below its content, and a long name pushed the fixed columns until every
  remaining heading wrapped — `OPEN DEFECTS` breaking across two lines while the body rows kept their
  height. Widths are now declared once per column and applied to the header and the cells through one
  component, so the two cannot disagree.

  **What was deliberately NOT migrated.** The `<table>` grids in Settings (API tokens, archive,
  repositories), the iteration scope panel and the attachment block are real semantic tables with
  3–5 fixed columns, no sort, no resize and no pagination. Moving those onto either shared component
  would REMOVE accessible table semantics that div-grids cannot express — `DataTableFrame`'s own
  docblock records why its grids have no `role="columnheader"`. A `<table>` is the right answer for a
  small static table; the rule is not "everything through the frame".

- **The nav's active state is a property of the GROUP, not of the parent's path.** `isActive(item.path)`
  asked whether the reader was on the dropdown's DEFAULT destination — its first child — so `Track`
  went dark on `Team Status`, `Plan` on `Timeboxes`, and `Portfolio` on both Capacity Planning and
  Release Tracking. `Quality` looked fine only because it has one child. `isGroupActive` consults the
  children UNFILTERED: a child the caller cannot see is one they cannot be standing on, so filtering
  first would make the answer depend on a permission read the question does not need.
- **The workspace mark is a `Link` home.** It was an inert `div` — the most-clicked affordance in a
  web app, doing nothing. A real anchor, never a `div` with `onClick`, so it carries a focus ring,
  answers Enter and offers open-in-new-tab; the `fe-consistency` ratchet counts hand-rolled clickable
  non-buttons for that reason. Its accessible name is the static `Home` rather than the workspace's,
  because that string has a three-way fallback ending in `Select workspace` and "Select workspace
  home" would be wrong exactly when the reader needs it to be right.
- **A create modal's date pair PREFILLS today + `DEFAULT_TIMEBOX_DAYS`** when both fields are
  REQUIRED, which is the New Iteration case: an empty pair was never a legal submission, so the modal
  opened asking for two dates that are, for almost every sprint, today and today plus a sprint.
  `todayIsoDate()` is timezone-correct on purpose — `new Date().toISOString().slice(0,10)` converts to
  UTC first and hands a planner in UTC+7 yesterday's date before 07:00 local — and `addIsoDays`
  anchors at UTC NOON so a DST boundary cannot move the calendar day. **Release create is
  deliberately left empty**: its dates are OPTIONAL there, and prefilling an optional field
  fabricates a release date nobody chose. Edit modals seed from the record and are unaffected.

## A parent's Schedule State is DERIVED FROM ITS TASK SET, not nudged by transitions

Rally's own rule (Broadcom, "Task State Updates Parent Schedule State"), and now ours —
`reconcileParentScheduleState` in `WorkItemsService`, called from task create, update and delete:

| the live task set | parent becomes |
|---|---|
| all `Defined` | `Defined` |
| all `Completed` | `Completed` |
| anything else | `In-Progress` |
| no live tasks | untouched — nothing to derive from |

**It was three per-event branches, and that shape is what broke it.** `TASK-FR-016` states two triggers
(all Tasks Completed; any Task reopened) and both were built; a Task STARTING was cited in the service's
own comment as Rally's behaviour ("otherwise → In Progress") and never implemented. So a Story read
`Defined` while a Task under it was In-Progress — a state Rally cannot be in, and the first thing a
reader checks to answer "is anyone working on this?". Reported from develop on 2026-08-22 as "the
roll-up stopped working"; it had never worked for that trigger, which is why nothing regressed and no
test caught it. A set-derived rule has no third trigger to forget.

- **CREATE and DELETE are part of the rule**, and no transition trigger could ever have covered them.
  Broadcom names both: "adding a task to a story in Idea will make the story Defined" and "adding a
  task to a story in Completed will make the story In Progress". Deleting the last OPEN task completes
  the parent exactly as completing it would have.
- **`accepted` and `release` are reconciled like any other state, and guarding them would have been the
  natural mistake.** Broadcom is silent on those two, so the literal rule un-accepts a Story because
  somebody added a Task — which reads like something to prevent. The repo had already decided it:
  `P3-TS-FR-041` (BA-confirmed 2026-07-24) moves a parent back "from ANY at-or-past-completed state —
  `completed`, `accepted` OR `release`", with a unit test asserting it. A guard here would have
  contradicted a confirmed rule and its own test. To reverse it, exempt those states in the reconciler
  and retire that case — both, or the two disagree.
- **`taskStateCounts` replaced `areAllTasksComplete`** for the same reason: "are they all complete"
  cannot answer two of the three cases, so the port returns a census.
- **The one divergence from Rally: we have no `Auto State Updates` switch.** Rally gates this whole
  behaviour per project/subscription, which is how it reconciles automation with `TASK-FR-016`'s "user
  may still change the parent status manually". Without it a manual parent state survives only until
  the next task write. Put to the BA; if they want the manual edit to win, that switch is the answer,
  not weakening the rule.
- Reached by every surface: the three SPA controls (Tasks tab, Iteration Status nested row, Team Status)
  all send `PATCH /v1/work-items/:id`, and Team Status' own task route delegates to this service. Pinned
  in `test/e2e/derived-invariants.e2e.spec.ts`, which asserts the STORED parent state — what every grid,
  report and burndown reads — not the response of the call that changed the Task.

## Task hours are THREE independent fields

`Estimate`, `To Do` and `Actual` never derive from each other (Portfolio SRS:141-147), with exactly
two automatic moves:

- **The FIRST Estimate copies itself to To Do, once** — and only while To Do is `null`. `0` is not
  "unset": a completed task has exactly that, so re-copying would undo the auto-zero below or
  overwrite a planner who typed 0 deliberately. The create path always did this; the update path did
  not, so estimating an existing task left To Do empty and the number had to be typed twice.
- **Completing a task sets To Do to 0**, and **reopening does NOT restore it** — the owner enters a new
  remaining value if there is one. This replaces the older `Estimate = To Do + Actual` display rule.

## A picker feeds from the WRITE's rule, never from a screen's

BA repro, Production, 2026-08-21: a Defect's `Parent Story` field offered nothing but
`No parent story`, and searching a Story's key answered `No matches`, so no Defect could be traced
to the User Story it was found against. All three Parent Story surfaces — the detail sidebar, Create
Work Item, and Log Defect — read `GET /work-items/backlog?type=story`.

- **The Backlog is a SCREEN, and `iteration_id IS NULL` is its defining rule** (see `listBacklog`,
  which explains why). `updateWorkItem` has no such rule: it accepts any non-deleted Story in the
  same project. So every Story already pulled into a sprint — the ones a Defect is most often raised
  against — was withheld from a picker whose own server would have taken it. The 50-row first page
  was a second, quieter cap on the same feed.
- **"No matches" was the symptom, not a search bug.** `SearchableSelect` filters the options it was
  HANDED, so a missing option and a broken search are the same fault seen twice. Read a picker's
  emptiness as a question about its FEED before touching the control.
- **`GET /work-items/story-options` is the fix** — the Story REFERENCE feed, mirroring
  `GET /portfolio-items/options` exactly: unpaged (a paged picker omits options past its first page
  without saying so), no schedule-state filter (a Defect against shipped work needs an ACCEPTED
  parent), `work_item:view` gated by the guard on the required `projectId`, and team-scoped in the
  service because that is a row boundary the guard cannot express. Declared ABOVE `@Get(':id')`, or
  Nest routes it into `ParseUUIDPipe` as a 400.
- **This is the Story analogue of "an iteration is assignable by SCOPE, never by LIFECYCLE"**
  (P6-VEL-004, above). Same shape, different field: a feed narrower than the write it feeds makes
  half a documented rule unreachable, and it presents as a persistence or search bug rather than as a
  missing option. When a picker and a write path disagree, the WRITE is the contract.
- Pinned over real HTTP in `test/e2e/parent-story-feed.e2e.spec.ts` (population, team scope, and the
  picker-offers-what-the-write-accepts round trip). A service spec cannot see it: the repository is
  mocked, so no predicate is exercised.

## A Task's Iteration is DERIVED, not cascaded

The BA says it three times — "A Task inherits Project, Team, Iteration and Release/Milestone context
THROUGH ITS PARENT Story/Defect" (`BUSINESS_BASELINE.md`), "no independent Iteration selector"
(`P1-TASK-011`), "without an independent Task iteration assignment" (`P2-IS-024`) — and real Rally
shows the field read-only. That is stronger than keeping two values in step: **a Task owns no
iteration value at all.**

- **`work.tasks.iteration_id` is a maintained mirror** (`trg_task_iteration_from_parent`, migration
  0095). It is re-read from `parent_id` on every insert and on any update touching `parent_id` or
  `iteration_id`, so reparenting follows the new parent for free and a raw-SQL write cannot diverge.
  Enforced in the DB because `db/seeds/**` writes `work.tasks` directly — the same reason
  `trg_sync_accepted_date` and `timebox_group_id` are triggers.
- **Moving a parent moves its Tasks** (`trg_cascade_iteration_to_tasks`, `AFTER UPDATE OF
iteration_id`). Before this, `createTask` inherited once at birth and nothing looked at the parent
  again, so a moved Story left its Tasks counting hours in the old sprint.
- **Passing an iteration for a Task is a REFUSAL** (`TASK_ITERATION_DERIVED`), not a silent
  discard — and on `createTask` it is a compile error, because the opts type no longer has the field.
  `CreateTaskSchema` dropped it too, so the contract does not advertise what the service refuses. The
  guard sits in `createWorkItem` as well: `POST /work-items` with `type: 'task'` skips the
  `createTask` wrapper entirely.
- **`teamId` is NOT derived.** A Task's team only DEFAULTS to its parent's and stays settable (SRS
  P1-04); `getScopedTaskHours` resolves `coalesce(task, parent, iteration)` deliberately. Only the
  Iteration is contractually derived.

## The archive is a place, and deleting from it is guarded

Archiving used to be a ONE-WAY DOOR with no room behind it. `GET /projects/:id/teams` narrows to
`teams.status = 'active'` deliberately (so no picker offers an archived team), and that was the only
teams feed the SPA used — so an archived team was invisible everywhere, including the Teams tab that
renders a Status column and a Restore action for it. Archived PROJECTS were better off: the list query
never filtered status, so only `listHealthByWorkspace` (the Home widget, correctly) hides them.

- **`DELETE /teams/:id` exists now, and refuses twice.** `TEAM_NOT_ARCHIVED` — delete is an operation on
  the archive, so the destructive step is always preceded by a reversible one that already removed the
  team from every picker. `TEAM_HAS_HISTORY` — and it NAMES the sources and counts, because "you cannot
  delete this" without saying what holds it is a dead end, and the holder is usually something the admin
  can move.
- **The guard is not belt-and-braces over a database constraint; it is the ONLY thing standing there.**
  `work_items.team_id`, `tasks.team_id`, `iterations.team_id` and `portfolio_items.team_id` carry **no
  foreign key** to `teams`, so a delete leaves them pointing at a row that is gone — silently, since
  every reader resolves the team name by join and simply renders nothing. The columns that DO have one
  are worse in the other direction: `member_capacity`, `iteration_daily_snapshots`,
  `iteration_team_baselines` and `release_team_targets` are `ON DELETE CASCADE`, so Postgres would
  accept the delete and take frozen report history with it. That is exactly what §488 exists to stop, so
  the rule is delete ONLY when there is nothing to destroy — §488 kept, rather than traded away.
- **`team_members` and `project_teams` are CLEANED, not counted.** They describe the team rather than
  delivery history, and they have no foreign key either — so `deleteTeam` removes them in the same
  transaction or `listByTeam` would keep returning members of a team that no longer exists.
- **Deleting drops the roster's permission cache.** RBE-06 grants project access FROM a roster row, so
  those users' cached assignments are stale the moment the team stops existing. The roster is read
  BEFORE the delete, or there is nothing left to read.
- **A project delete from the archive is a DECLARED DIVERGENCE from `P0-PRJ-008`**, which says an
  archived project offers Restore ONLY. The product owner asked for delete on 2026-08-20 and it reuses
  the existing soft delete (`deleted_at`), so it is reversible in the database and invisible in the app.
  Teams have no soft delete, which is why their rule is the strict one above.

## An archived Team keeps its hours

"Archive Team does not delete the linked Work Item/Sprint history" (DB design §488), so Team Capacity
still reports an archived team's rows — a total that shrinks when a team is disbanded is worse than
one that explains itself. The row carries `archived: true` and renders `TEAM_STATUS_STYLE.archived`,
because the global Team picker hides archived teams and nothing else on screen would say the team no
longer exists. The flag is ORed across the capacity rows and the task rows: both reach the same
bucket, and a task row whose `teams` join missed must not clear what a capacity row set correctly.

**That sentence used to credit the wrong filter, and the difference was a live defect.** It said the
picker hides them "because `app-shell.tsx` filters `status === 'active'`" — but the status on those
rows is `project_teams.status`, the LINK's status, projected over the joined `teams` row. So the
client filter only ever dropped UNLINKED links, and an archived-but-still-linked team was offered
everywhere that feed reaches: every team picker, and the Capacity plan's Add Team dialog, whose write
path requires both statuses and answers `CAPACITY_TEAM_NOT_FOUND`. That is the "another eligible Team
cannot be added" half of P5-CP-006 — a picker offering what the server refuses. The predicate now
lives in `ProjectTeamDrizzleRepository` (`eq(teams.status, 'active')`, and an inner join, since a NULL
team can no longer satisfy it), so the claim is true server-side and both callers get the narrower
set. Narrowing the shared query rather than adding a parameter is deliberate: `projectTeamContext`'s
own docblock requires the server to count exactly the population the picker offers. **Read a
`status` column twice before trusting it — a join can project a link's status where a row's status
is what the sentence means.**

## A rule stated as an INVARIANT cannot be implemented as one write's hook

Two BA rules were specified as conditions and built as hooks on one particular write, so a different
write reaching the same state left the rule unsatisfied. Both are now pinned by
`test/e2e/derived-invariants.e2e.spec.ts`.

- **Iteration auto-accept is a condition over MEMBERSHIP**: "a non-empty Iteration auto-changes to
  `Accepted` when all ASSIGNED Story/Defect items are `Accepted`" (BUSINESS_BASELINE:12, BR-IT-02) —
  and *assigned* is what a scope change alters. The check only ran on a `scheduleState` transition, so
  moving the last open Story OUT, or bulk-assigning an accepted Story IN, left the iteration Committed
  while the Iteration Status tile read ACCEPTED 100%. Every membership write now re-evaluates BOTH
  affected iterations (the one left and the one joined). Safe to run on every move because
  `autoAcceptIterationIfComplete` only ever goes `planning|committed → accepted` — the same rule's
  "does not auto-reverse" clause is what makes that true.
- **A Milestone's target window EQUALS its linked Releases' MIN/MAX** (P3-MS-FR-011/012, §73).
  `recalcTargetDates` ran on create, update, link writes — and on `getMilestone`, a repair on the READ
  path. It never ran when a linked Release's own dates were edited, and `listMilestones` reads the
  persisted columns, so the detail page self-healed while the list showed a stale window. **The
  self-healing is why it hid**: the surface a reviewer opens was the one that repaired itself.
  Migration 0097 moves this to triggers covering all three invalidating writes (a release date edit, a
  link add/remove, a manual write to a linked milestone, which §73 makes read-only), and the read-path
  repair is gone. `§75` is respected: removing the last link leaves the dates alone rather than
  inferring NULL.

**The smell to watch for: a value repaired on read.** It makes the defect invisible on exactly the
screen someone checks, and it leaves every other reader stale.

**Its sibling: a value HIDDEN on read.** Migration 0118 deletes the Workspace Admin's
`project_members` rows (§2.1/AC-8), and `db/seeds/demo.ts` wrote the same row straight back — and
`pnpm db:migrate` runs that seed, so every local and CI database undid the migration on the spot. What
made it invisible is that the fix's own three readers (the roster query, `memberCount`, and the POST
refusal) all correctly hide such a row, so nothing on screen would ever have shown it coming back. It
was not cosmetic either: `AccessService.effectiveAssignments` synthesizes a project grant FROM that
table, so the row is dormant only while the user is a WA — demote them and it becomes a live Project
Admin grant no roster displays. **Whenever a migration DELETES rows, grep `db/seeds/**` for the writer
before assuming the deletion holds.**

**And a third: state FROZEN before its source arrived.** The user-access modal's draft materialised
`teamIds` from its baseline the moment any part of a row was edited, but team memberships come from
their own query — so choosing `Editor` before `/v1/teams/{id}/members` resolved froze `[]` in, and a
draft SHADOWS the baseline, so the real memberships could never reach it. §2.2's "an Editor needs a
Team" guard then stayed true forever: `Review Changes` disabled permanently, the user's own team
unchecked, no way out but closing the modal. **A draft must hold only what the user TOUCHED** —
`undefined` meaning "resolve against the baseline when it arrives", the same absent-versus-empty
distinction a capacity plan's window and an allocation's value already rely on. Diagnosis note, because
it presented as a flaky test (2 runs in 8): raising the `waitFor` timeout to 5s did NOT help, and that
is what proves frozen state rather than a slow render. Pin such a case with a DEFERRED promise so the
ordering is deterministic instead of lucky.

## Archive ordering cuts both ways

An Epic with active child Features cannot be archived — and a Feature whose Epic is archived cannot be
RESTORED (`PORTFOLIO_PARENT_ARCHIVED`). The second half was missing, so the forbidden state was
reachable in three legal steps: archive the Feature, archive the now-childless Epic, restore the
Feature. That leaves an active Feature under a hidden parent, which is what `assertReferences` refuses
on every other write. The message names the Epic's key, because an archived parent is invisible in
every list.

## A record's Project is chosen ONCE, by the context, and never again

Settled on the BA's 2026-08-17 retest of **P5-PI-003**, and it applies to every type at once:
`WIC-FR-004` AC #11 ("Project cannot be changed in Quick Create, Create with details, **or any reused
modal**"), `WID-FR-017` AC #9 ("moving between Projects unsupported"), Task Management AC #14 (a
Task's Project equals its parent's), and P5 §4 / §45 / §339 for a Feature and an Epic. So the Project
field is an auto-filled, read-only display on every create surface, and to create elsewhere the user
changes the **global Project context** first.

- **There is no editable project cell or field anywhere in the SPA.** `ProjectSelectCell` is
  DELETED, not gated — `shared/ui/project-cell.tsx` exports only the read-only `ProjectCell`, and
  the `ProjectOption` shape went with it. A `canEdit={false}` prop is one prop away from `true`, and
  there is no role or surface for which the move is legal, so "read-only" is a property of the
  component rather than of a caller's argument. Same reasoning as `createTask`'s iteration field
  being a compile error rather than a runtime refusal.
- **This REVERSES the previous answer to the same BA case, which is why it is recorded.** P5-PI-003
  first read as "selecting AUDIT26 returns an unexpected error", and the fix was to NARROW the
  Portfolio grid's move picker to unarchived projects the caller held `portfolio:edit` on
  (`updateItem` authorises a move in both directions). That was a correct reading of a wrong
  question: the BA's answer is that there is no picker. `portfolio-page.test.tsx` used to assert the
  narrowed option list and now asserts the absence of the control — a test inverted, not deleted.
- **The SERVER refuses it too, and this note used to say the opposite.** It first shipped as a display
  rule, on the reading that the report scoped itself to "FE và business behavior". That reading was
  wrong by one word: a server refusal is not a schema or DB change, it is business behavior, which
  that same sentence includes — and rule 4 of the report says the move "is not supported" flatly.
  `UpdatePortfolioItemSchema` no longer carries `projectId`, so the contract does not advertise what
  is refused, and `updateItem` answers `PORTFOLIO_ITEM_PROJECT_IMMUTABLE` for a different project
  while treating the SAME project as a no-op (a client echoing the record back is not refused for
  agreeing). `applyProjectMove` is DELETED with it: the destination-team reset, the Release clear, the
  cross-project Epic unlink and the surviving-Milestone filter existed only for that write, and the
  spec's `innerJoin` + `selectDistinct` mock chains went with them rather than standing as scaffolding
  for a call nobody makes.

  **`PORTFOLIO_ITEM_HAS_CAPACITY_ALLOCATION` did NOT go with it** — that rule also guards the
  allocate side, and it now lives only where the capacity module enforces it.

  Real Rally DOES offer this move (Broadcom's project-hierarchy guide: "Rally recommends you update
  the project field to reflect which team is handling the work"), so this is a **declared divergence**,
  recorded on `UpdatePortfolioItemSchema` as well. If the BA reverses it, the field, the guard and
  `applyProjectMove` all come back together — a picker without the reconciliation would leave a Team
  and a Release pointing into the old project.
- **There is NO exception left — Iteration create used to be one, and the BA closed it.** This note
  read "the ONE Project picker that stays is on Iteration create", on §92-93's sentence that a
  Workspace Admin "vẫn có quyền đổi Project/Team trong quick create/detail nếu cần". BA `c42df59`
  rewrites that row: `P2-IT-FR-011` lists the quick-create field as a "read-only Project" and
  `P2-IT-FR-001D` says a Workspace Admin/Admin "cannot change Iteration Project inside create/detail.
  To create in another Project, change the global Project context first." So the picker is DELETED
  rather than disabled, and the detail panel's `ProjectCell` was already right. `UpdateIterationSchema`
  never carried `projectId`, and that absence is now documented on the schema so it is not helpfully
  filled in. **The second sentence of FR-001D still stands**: Team may be changed, "only to a Team
  valid for the fixed Project" — which is why the Team picker is scoped to `projectId` and
  `assertTeamInProject` is the enforcement.
- **`ReadOnlyFieldValue` (`shared/ui/form-field.tsx`) is the box these render in** — an input-shaped
  `<div>`, deliberately not a `disabled` input, so the fixed value sits on the same baseline as the
  editable fields beside it without announcing itself as a control that might become enabled. It
  takes no `onChange` by design. Three surfaces had hand-rolled its class string.

## Declared divergences from the BA, in Capacity Planning

Each was ruled on. None is drift, and none should be "fixed" on sight — and note the first one is a
divergence that has since been REVERSED, kept here because the reasoning will come up again.

- **Rollup and Complete no longer filter children by Project+Release — the BA REVERSED that divergence
  on 2026-08-17** (`P5-CP-029`, retest, Confirmed Fail, P0). It used to be a declared divergence in
  Rally's favour: "If a portfolio item includes allocated points/counts, the Project and Release fields
  in the story must match the plan for that story to be included in the Rollup calculation", on the
  grounds that without it a long-lived Feature inflates every plan that touches it. `P5-CAP-AC-016` and
  SRS §311/§318 state the formula with NO qualifier — `SUM(child.planEstimate WHERE child belongs to
  Feature)` — and the release half is what made the BA's repro read zero: an ordinary Story carries no
  Release of its own, so a Feature with one Completed 3-point child reported `Rollup = 0, Complete = 0`
  on the plan header, on the Team row and on the Features tab at once. The predicate is now the link
  plus `deleted_at is null`, in `capacity-metrics.sql.ts`. **Do not re-add the qualifier without a
  fresh ruling.**

  Two things had to move with it, and they are the part worth remembering:

  - **A team SLICE cannot be a strict `work_items.team_id = ?`.** That was tier 1 of the rule with no
    tier 2, and SQL equality never matches NULL — `work_items.team_id` is nullable and mostly unset —
    so every unteamed child fell out of every team slice. `teamSliceChildScope` attributes a child to
    its own team when that team holds an allocation of the Feature on this plan, and otherwise to the
    Feature's OWNER (`is_primary`, Rally's Planned Team Assignment). Exactly one slice, and the slices
    SUM to the Feature's own total, which is `AC-017`'s reconciliation requirement.
  - **A team row is the SUM OF ITS OWN ALLOCATION ROWS** (SRS §341/§347 say precisely that), not a
    separate aggregate query. `repo.teamMetrics` and `childWorkPredicate` are gone: two definitions of
    one number are what let the Team row, the Feature rows under it and the plan header (which sums the
    team rows in `planTotals`) disagree about one child.
- **Nested `Dependencies` renders `0`, not `—`.** The BA's catalog suggests a dash (§205); Rally's column
  is a COUNT, dependencies are genuinely unimplemented rather than unknown, and `0` is true where a dash
  would read as "not known". Note this is the one place the app's own absent-value rule (`--` everywhere
  else) is deliberately not applied.
- **The cutline keeps the overflowing Feature BELOW the line.** Rally's Items-tab doc is the deciding
  sentence: "Items above the cutline fit within the defined plan capacity. Items below the line exceed
  the capacity of the plan." SRS §189 says the line is drawn "after the first Feature where cumulative
  planning Estimated reaches or exceeds Plan total Capacity", which puts that Feature above the line. The
  two differ by exactly one row — capacity 100 against 90, 20, 5 puts the 20 below here and above under
  §189.

  Worth knowing that this one was shipped §189's way and reverted: the BA reading went in under a
  blanket "align to the BA" instruction, and Broadcom's wording was only checked afterwards.

  This note used to add that `Rollup`, `Complete` and the cutline were "all decided the same way — the
  product's documented behaviour wins", and to warn that reversing one meant reversing all three. **The
  BA reversed the Rollup/Complete child filter on 2026-08-17 and left the cutline alone**, so the trio
  is deliberately split now: the cutline still follows Broadcom, the child filter follows
  `P5-CAP-AC-016`. Recorded rather than deleted because the next person to read either bullet will
  wonder which rule governs — the answer is per-rule, and each one names its own source.

  Verified at
  `techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/ca-enterprise-software/valueops/rally/rally-help/planning/capacity-planning-page/view-capacity-plan-details/capacity-plan-items-tab.html`
  (the same page carries the Project/Release sentence above, for Complete and for estimated points).
  The cutline was removed from Rally and later restored, which is why it may be absent from an older
  screenshot or a different edition.

## Publishing a plan is ONE decision per FEATURE, and the Release rule is EQUALITY

Both halves were `P5-CP-035` (retest 2026-08-17, Confirmed Partial, P1), and both are easy to
reintroduce because the natural thing to iterate is `listAllocations`.

- **A split Feature has N allocation rows and ONE publish decision.** Same window, same Release answer,
  same advisory. Looping the rows wrote the Feature N times (churning `updated_at`) and pushed its
  advisory N times, which reads as N separate problems — and gave the SPA a duplicate React key.
  `publishTargets` folds the rows to unique Features BEFORE anything is written or reported, and
  `unallocated` becomes an OR over the Feature's rows, so a Feature holding one team row and one parked
  row is assigned rather than both updated AND reported as having no team.
- **`windowsMatch` is EQUALITY on both ends, never containment.** AC-019 says the Release field is
  written "only when the Plan planned start/end dates MATCH the selected Release start/end dates", and
  the consequence is the bit that bites the COPY: a plan ending EARLIER than its release fails the check
  while being nowhere near outside it. The old advisory said "the plan's window reaches outside its
  release", which is a fault the planner cannot find. It now names both windows —
  `Plan dates X to Y do not exactly match Release dates A to B. Planned dates were updated; Release was
not changed.` — and the pre-publish modal says "exactly match" rather than "falls inside".
  Both sides are normalised to date-only first (`dateOnly`), so the comparison can never silently become
  a timestamp one with timezone as the invisible variable.

The release dates in that advisory come from the release REFERENCE feed in the SPA
(`useReleaseOptions`), not from the publish response: the reason code is the server's contract, and a
second server field for two dates the client already holds would be one more number free to disagree
with the plan header beside it.

## An allocation's value is a FIXED SNAPSHOT with a source label

`capacity_plan_allocations.value` is NOT NULL and carries `source` (`feature_estimate` | `manual`),
which is migration 0101 reversing 0077 on purpose. Anything that reads or writes an allocation must
respect this:

- **Never resolve an allocation's charge on read.** SRS §11 is `fixed allocation.value set during
  planning/replanning`, and §337 defines Team Estimated as `SUM(allocation.value)`. 0077 had made the
  column nullable so a blank Estimate could resolve to the Feature's own estimate per request. That
  meant editing a Feature's Refined Estimate silently moved every Draft plan that had assigned it — a
  planner's committed demand changed with no action on the plan — and no surface could compute a total
  from the stored rows, so five of them re-resolved and agreed by luck.
- **`source` is why the value can be fixed.** 0077's stated objection was real: "a defaulted 8 and a
  deliberate 8 were indistinguishable." The BA answers it with a label, not a null (§185: blank
  "copies the Feature's top-down estimate into a fixed allocation row and labels its source `Feature
  Estimate`"; §186: a supplied one "becomes a fixed `Manual` allocation row").
- **The copy happens at WRITE time, in the plan's unit** — `defaultAllocationEstimate`, Refined →
  Preliminary, deliberately skipping Total Allocated so a blank field cannot commit the sum of the
  allocations it is creating (§294). `value: null` on a PATCH means RE-COPY, not clear: the emptied
  cell re-baselines the row against the Feature's forecast as it stands now.
- **A tier is a property of a FEATURE, not of an allocation row.** AC-014 resolves Feature Estimated
  from Total Allocated (team-assigned rows only) → Refined → Preliminary, once, over the aggregate.
  Allocation rows have a `source`; only item rows have a `tier`.
- **A merged parked row keeps its source only when exactly ONE row folded in.** A sum of two rows is a
  number no single rule produced, so it is `manual` — calling it a Feature estimate would misreport
  the Feature's size.

## Capacity: what refuses, and why

Three references into a capacity plan are now REFUSALS rather than silent repairs, all following
`RELEASE_HAS_CAPACITY_PLAN` on release delete — the pattern this repo already chose:

- **Moving a Feature to another project** while it is allocated
  (`PORTFOLIO_ITEM_HAS_CAPACITY_ALLOCATION`). A plan belongs to one project, so the Feature took
  nothing with it: the rows stayed behind, kept feeding that team's Estimated, the plan total and
  the cutline, and publish wrote the OLD project's Release onto it — the state `assertReferences`
  itself rejects. Deleting the rows instead would destroy committed numbers on a plan the person
  moving the Feature may not even be able to see. `applyPlanToFeature` also filters on the plan's
  project now, so the write is incapable of crossing projects even for rows that predate the guard.
- **Unlinking a team from a project** while it sits on one of that project's plans
  (`PROJECT_TEAM_HAS_CAPACITY_PLAN`). `project_teams` is a soft status flip, so
  `fk_capacity_plan_teams_team ON DELETE RESTRICT` never fires. `Remove Team` on the plan is the
  deliberate action and it re-parks the demand (AC-005), so the refusal costs nothing.
- **`assertTeamInProject` requires both the LINK and the TEAM to be active.** It checked neither, so
  an unlinked or archived team could still be added to a plan — recreating exactly what migration
  0085 was written to clean up.

**`capacity:view_draft` is the fourth capacity code, and it is now REDUNDANT — the requirement it
existed for is gone.** It was added because AC-012 was read as keeping a read-only Project Admin
"opening Draft and Published plans", which `capacity:manage || capacity:publish` could not express.
That reading is STALE: on `product-docs` `origin/main`, `P5-CAP-AC-012` says Capacity Planning "uses the
fixed Phase 4 Project Access baseline and has **no temporary editable Full/View permission row**",
`P5-CAP-AC-010` says "Editor/No Access do not access Capacity Planning", and `P5-CAP-AC-013` is marked
N/A with "Viewer level removed". So there is no read-only planner, and every role holding
`capacity:view_draft` (`workspace_admin`, `project_admin`) also holds `capacity:manage` — the code
cannot distinguish anyone. It is still granted and still read, deliberately: retiring a permission that
sits in live role arrays needs a migration, not a catalogue edit, and the BA has been asked to confirm
no future read-only planner is intended. Backfilled by migration 0094.

**The lesson worth more than the fact:** this note asserted an AC that the BA had since changed, and two
e2e tests were built on it — constructing a read-only planner from a CUSTOM ROLE, pinning a shape the
SRS had deleted. Read `product-docs` `origin/main` rather than a summary of it before building on an AC;
the local checkout is a gap-audit branch and lags where the BA authors.

## An invitation binds to an ADDRESS, and grants a real role

Two independent faults on the one flow that onboards every user, both fixed together:

- **Acceptance is bound to the invited email.** It used to validate only `pending` + not-expired, so
  the token was a bearer capability — a forwarded link, a shared inbox or a copied URL made the wrong
  person a member at the invited role (`INVITATION_EMAIL_MISMATCH` now refuses it, case-insensitively,
  because an IdP may return a differently-cased local part for the same mailbox).
- **`workspace_members.role_id` is authoritative for NOTHING.** `AccessService` resolves permissions
  from `user_role_assignments`, and this module's own members query reads the role from there too.
  `addMember` writes only the denormalised column, so the invited role was written where nobody reads
  it: a user invited as Project Admin landed with whatever `ensureDefaultRole` gives a first SSO
  login, and the admin who sent the invitation saw the intended role nowhere. Accept now calls
  `grantWorkspaceRole` **inside the same transaction** and invalidates the permission cache after
  commit, like `assignRole` does. Any new path that "assigns a role" must write the assignment table.

**Who SENDS the invitation email depends on `ENTRA_GUEST_INVITE_ENABLED`, and that is the ordering an
external collaborator depends on.** `inviteMember` wrote both outbox rows in one transaction and two
independent relays drained them — the email relay every 5s AND woken instantly by `wakeEmailRelay`, the
Entra guest relay on a 30s cron with no wake signal at all. So the link arrived in under a second and
the invitee's guest object in our tenant up to 30s later, plus Microsoft's directory replication: an
invitee who clicks immediately cannot authenticate (`NO_CONNECTION` from our login box, `AADSTS50020`
from Microsoft's), intermittently, and it reads as the feature being broken. With the flag ON the email
is now scheduled by the ONE component that knows the guest is ready — `EntraGuestInviteRelayService`,
in the same transaction that marks the row `sent` and writes `entra_guest_object_id`. Flag OFF is
untouched: nothing is enqueued, `GuestInviteSchedulerService.schedule` answers `false`, and the email
goes out inline. Four consequences worth knowing before touching either half:

- **A permanent Graph refusal schedules NO email** (invalid address, `User.Invite.All` unconsented, B2B
  invitations disabled tenant-wide). The invitee cannot authenticate, so a link is a dead end that also
  burns the one-shot token; the dead-letter log and `last_error` are the signal. **The operator action is
  CANCEL AND RE-INVITE, not `Resend Invitation`** — resend reuses the same `idempotencyKey`
  (`invitation.id`) with `onConflictDoNothing`, so a row already at `status = 'failed'` is untouched and
  the guest is never re-provisioned; only a NEW invitation mints a new key. A benign `proxyAddresses`
  collision DOES email — that invitee is already a directory member.
- **The flag gates ENQUEUEING, not draining.** The relay used to skip polling entirely while the flag
  was off; now that a queued row also owes the email, that would strand the invitee in silence, so
  committed intents are always drained.
- **`guest_invite_outbox.invite_token` holds the RAW token** (migration 0124), because only its sha256
  is persisted and the relay could not otherwise build `inviteUrl`. Scrubbed in the same write that
  schedules the email, and on a terminal failure. NULL also *means* "this row owes no email", which is
  what `resendInvitation` passes — it mails its own rotated token inline.
- **Both writers key the email on `invitation.id`**, so a flag flipped mid-flight cannot produce two
  invitation emails; the relay additionally refuses to mail a token whose hash no longer matches the
  invitation, or an invitation that is no longer `pending`.

## A cross-project LIST is scoped by `listReadableProjectIds`, not by `workspace_id`

`AccessService.listReadableProjectIds` is the authorization fact behind every cross-project list — its
own docblock says so, and Portfolio already used it. `GET /v1/projects` did not: no
`@RequirePermission`, and a query filtering on `workspace_id` + `deleted_at IS NULL` alone, so every
project's key, name, description, owner, dates and counts was readable by any authenticated principal
including one with zero role assignments. PRJ-FR-001 and §10 both say otherwise.

**`null` means UNRESTRICTED and an empty array means "nothing".** The sentinel exists precisely because
those two are different answers, so a caller that flattens `null` to `[]` fails closed and one that
flattens `[]` to "all" leaks the workspace. The repository short-circuits the empty case rather than
emitting `inArray(col, [])`, which is not portable as "match nothing".

`GET /projects/:id/members` was open for the same reason and is now `project:view` scoped to the path
id — **with no `resource` key**, because the param IS the project id and there is nothing to resolve
(`'project'` is deliberately not a `ScopedResource`).

**That note used to end "still open", and both halves are now CLOSED — recorded because the
resolution is the pattern, not the exception.** `GET :id/members-with-profile` was deferred behind
"gating it needs the feed split first", because it fed the Portfolio and Projects owner pickers as
well as User Management. The split shipped (`:id/member-options` for pickers, `:id/members-with-profile`
for the administrative roster) and the administrative half now carries `workspace:view`. And
`GET :id/members` — the third route, paged, with `roleId` and account `status` behind an in-service
claim that amounted to `assertActive` — is **DELETED**, not gated: it had no consumer anywhere, and a
gated dead route keeps a payload alive for whoever finds it next while reading, in review, as a
considered decision about an audience. Its absence is asserted in `authz-cluster.e2e.spec.ts` for a
Workspace ADMIN, because a 404 for an Editor is also what a gate would produce and would prove
nothing.

**And the `permission` argument has to actually decide something.** It did not, for the membership half:
`listReadableProjectIds` unioned a raw `project_members` query in unconditionally, so every project the
caller held an active row on was readable **regardless of whether that row's access level granted the
permission being asked about**. It was written when membership was the only per-project fact and it
survived the move to `access_level`, by which point `effectiveAssignments` already synthesized the same
rows correctly filtered — so it was duplication for a permission the level grants, and a silent
over-grant for one it does not. What it opened: `portfolio:view`, which `editor` deliberately withholds,
so **every project Editor read every field of every Epic and Feature in their projects** — the one
surface `P5-PI-FR-017` and §3.2:85 hide from them. No other caller was affected, because the rest ask
for `project:view` or `work_item:view`, which is exactly why it stayed invisible. Membership now reaches
the result only through the permission-filtered synthesis; the generalisable rule is that **a boundary
taking a permission must not union in a source that ignores it**, and the failure reads as a boundary in
review. Two second-order effects, both deliberate: the synthesis filters on `isProjectAccessLevel` where
the deleted query used `isNotNull`, so an unrecognised level is no longer readable; and it rides the
5-minute assignment cache, so a membership row written by raw SQL is invisible to cross-project lists
until `invalidateUser` is called.

**Closing it needed the picker split in the same change**, and that is the pattern now, not a one-off:
the emptied list was also the only feed for the `Feature` field on a Story/Defect, so the fix is
`GET /portfolio-items/options` (id, key, name, project) gated on `work_item:view`. The BA is **SILENT**
on whether an Editor may set a Story's Feature, so this is a **declared reading** and has been put to
them: §5.2:124 makes that field the only way Feature membership is ever set, §3.2:79 gives an Editor the
Story, and the closest precedent is the BA's own one field over — `Phase 2/02_Iterations/SRS.md:393`,
"Timeboxes hidden; may update Work Item Iteration through approved Backlog/Iteration Status flows only"
— hidden surface, permitted field, therefore a feed. Release is decided the *other* way and says so in
words ("cannot assign Release", BL §8:294), which is why that one is refused in `WorkItemsService`
instead. **Where the BA wanted a field withheld from an Editor it wrote a sentence; it wrote none for
Feature.** If they rule it like Release, the reversal is this route plus one SPA field. The feed is
single-project per §5.3:133, which is what lets the GUARD check it (`{ from: 'query', field:
'projectId' }`) instead of a service-side narrowing — so the service deliberately makes **no**
authorization call, pinned by a spec. Note the API still *accepts* a cross-project Feature link
(`assertFeatureLinkable` permits it, because Rally's rollup matches `feature_id` alone) while the picker
no longer offers one: 0 such rows exist, and the BA's field scope wins over offering it.

**HOME's two aggregates were the last cross-project reads still scoped by `workspace_id` alone**, and
`GET /work-items/summary`'s own `@AuthorizedInService('scoped by listReadableProjectIds')` decorator
said otherwise — the identical false citation `listProjectHealth` carried until an e2e spec was written
for it. So after a Workspace Admin removed a user's access to a project, Home still reported that
project's active sprints, open work items, blocked items and open defects, and `My Work` still named its
items and project (`GAP-P4-RBAC-003`, against Phase 4 §2.2/§6, which put an unassigned project out of
"navigation, selectors, search **or results**"). `@SelfScoped` on `/work-items/my` was true and never
sufficient: *assigned to me* bounds whose the item is, not which project it may be read in, and an item
stays assigned after access is removed. Both now take `project:view` — the same code the projects list
and Project Health take, so the tile row, the list it links to and the health table cannot be counted in
three different populations. **A decorator is a note, not a check**; the four cases in
`work-items.service.spec.ts` are the check, and they assert BOTH sentinel directions, because a test
that only forwards an array also passes when `null` is flattened to `[]` — which fails closed and shows
a Workspace Admin all zeros.

## A PERSISTED selection outlives the grant it was made under

`app-context.store`'s `project` and `team` are zustand `persist` state, so a revoked project survives in
localStorage and every reader trusts it. `useInitialProject` is the ONE reconciler — it already replaced
a selection missing from `GET /v1/projects` **whenever some other project remained**, and returned early
when the list was empty, which is precisely the No Access principal the rule is about. So the shell's
context trigger kept printing `TEST · All Teams`, the breadcrumb kept naming the project, and every
project-scoped query kept being issued for it, while the nav, the Project list and `/backlog` were all
correctly empty or denied. Reconcile in that hook and nowhere else; a second copy of the rule is how the
header and the nav come to disagree.

Three properties of it are load-bearing and none is obvious:

- **The list is the authority.** `GET /v1/projects` is scoped by `listReadableProjectIds`, so a project
  absent from a **resolved** response is one the server will not serve. Clearing is the server's answer
  applied to client state, not a guess.
- **`undefined` decides nothing, in EITHER direction.** It is both "in flight" and "failed", so it must
  not invent a selection *and* must not clear a good one — a network blink would otherwise evict a
  reader from their own project.
- **Clearing the project clears the Team with it.** A Team belongs to the project being left, which is
  what the shell's own switcher and `adoptRecordProject` already do.

## Changing EITHER half of the delivery context lands on Home

`SHELL-FR-005`: "Khi đổi Project hoặc Team từ context selector, navigate về Home của context mới và
invalidate/refetch toàn bộ Project/Team-scoped query. Không giữ route hoặc dữ liệu của context cũ."
Both halves, one rule, in `selectProjectContext` (`widgets/app-shell/app-shell.tsx`).

- **A TEAM-only change navigates too, and this REVERSES the narrower reading shipped in #467** —
  that Team is merely a scope filter, so throwing the reader to Home would undo the narrowing they
  just asked for. The requirement admits no such exception, and the RECORD routes are why it wins: a
  work-item detail or an Iteration Status row belongs to the context it was opened under, so an
  Editor moving between their own teams would otherwise sit on a record their new scope refuses.
- **The invalidation is unconditional for both.** A team change used to drop `['work-items']` alone,
  which is narrower than the rule and narrower than the truth — iterations, capacity, reports, Team
  Status and every picker are team-scoped as well, so each kept serving the previous team's rows
  until its own staleness expired.
- Pinned by `apps/web/src/test/e2e/context-switch.e2e.ts`, which starts on `/backlog` so "landed on
  Home" cannot pass vacuously. The switcher had NO journey of its own before, which is how the Team
  half shipped with the opposite behaviour.

## A sort affordance must order by the value the cell RENDERS

Iteration Status offered one on Owner and compared `assigneeId` — a uuid — so the column sorted into
an order arbitrary to every reader, indistinguishable from a broken sort. Three separate faults, all
under `P2-IS-FR-025/026`, and each was invisible in a different way:

- **Owner sorted by uuid.** Fixed by comparing the joined `assigneeName`, which exists only because
  the read models now join the name (see "A NAME belongs to the ROW").
- **Dev Owner had no mapping AND no `sortCol`.** Its header was inert in both directions.
- **Flow State declared a `sortCol` with no case**, so it fell through to `return 0` and clicking it
  did nothing. It orders by `scheduleState`, the field its own cell reads and writes.

Two rules came out of it that apply to any grid:

- **Absent sorts LAST ascending, FIRST descending** — the same rule `keysetCondition` applies
  server-side, so a column sorted on the client and the same column sorted by the server cannot
  disagree about where blanks belong. Comparing a missing owner as `''` floats every unassigned row
  to the top of an A-Z sort, and an unestimated row ranks as a deliberate zero.
- **Iteration Status sorts on the CLIENT deliberately.** `useIterationStatus` follows the cursor and
  loads the whole iteration (the Board view needs every row for drag), so the set is complete and a
  server `sortBy` would be a second definition of one ordering — §286 lists the param, but the grid
  it describes does not page. The Backlog is the opposite case and sorts server-side, which is why
  `keysetCondition` grew an expression overload: `assignee` / `devOwner` seek on the same
  `coalesce(display_name, email)` the cell renders, so the order and its own cursor cannot diverge
  on a user with no display name. `iteration` stays unsortable on the Backlog (every row there is
  unscheduled, so it could only be a no-op) and `release` needs a join that query does not carry.

## A RECORD route must own its denied state; its guard cannot

`RequirePermission` resolves the code against the **selected** project, and renders its children when
that read itself fails ("we could not ask" is not "you may not"). `/item/$itemKey` resolves a
workspace-unique key, so `GET /work-items/by-key` deliberately carries no `@RequirePermission` and
asserts `work_item:view` on the row's own project after loading it — meaning the refusal that matters
arrives at the PAGE, as a 403, on a project the guard never consulted. With the page's only non-record
branch a "not found" line, `/item/US-17` rendered a BLANK page for a reader with no access: no statement,
no recovery action, one URL away from a `/backlog` that gets it right (Phase 4 §7).

Two things fell out of fixing it that generalise:

- **A query that throws `new Error(apiErrorMessage(...))` discards the status**, so a page cannot tell a
  403 from a 500 and `queryClient`'s own `retry` predicate — which reads `error.status` to stop retrying
  4xx — saw `undefined` and retried refusals. `ApiError` carries it; throw that wherever a surface
  branches on the outcome.
- **Three outcomes, three sentences**: `AccessDenied` (403), the key named back (a 404 mapped to
  `null`), `LoadErrorState` (anything else). A status we cannot read is a load failure, NEVER a refusal.

## A route's permission code must be one the intended role can hold

`GET /work-items/by-key` carried `workspace:view` — admin-only, since `workspace:*` is
admin-reserved and neither Project Admin nor Project Member holds any `workspace:*` code. It is the
sole resolver behind `/item/$itemKey`, so **every notification click and ID cell 403'd for both
non-admin roles** while the service's own `assertProjectPermission(work_item:view)` would have allowed
them. It now carries no decorator, deliberately: item keys are workspace-unique so the owning project
is unknown until the row loads, which is the same resolve-then-check shape as
`PATCH /work-items/reorder`. Same class of bug: `POST /iterations/:id/work-items` required
`iteration:edit` while the Add New button was gated on `work_item:create`, so a Project Member saw the
button and got a 403 for an item they can create from the Backlog.

**The pattern to watch for:** a gate chosen for where the id lives rather than for what the action is.
It is invisible in testing because the dev principal is a Workspace Admin whose `workspace:*` masks
every one of them — exactly how the `report:view` bug survived to migration 0092.

## Declared divergences from the BA, in the access model

Three rulings made on 2026-08-14, after an eight-slice audit cross-checked the code against BA main
(`product-docs` `55e7dbb`) and against real Broadcom Rally. None is drift; none should be "fixed" on
sight. The audit and its sourced Rally research are in
`product-docs/projects/mini-rally/09_Gap_Audit/`.

- **There is NO `Viewer` level, and Rally disagrees.** The BA removed it (`product-docs` `55e7dbb`,
  2026-08-14). It was restored by architect ruling the same day and **removed again on the BA's
  instruction** — migrations 0113 then 0115. The model is Workspace Admin plus per-Project `admin` or
  `editor`, with **No Access implicit** when no active `project_members` row exists; `No Access` is
  never a stored value or a dropdown choice, only the absence of a row reached through `Remove`.

  Recorded because it will come up again, and because the next person to read Broadcom's docs will
  reach for it. Real Rally's `ProjectPermission.Role` is No Access / Viewer / Editor / Project Admin,
  and its Viewer is load-bearing five ways: the documented answer to "make this user read-only", the
  **provisioning default** for a new user, one of four Quick Filter Toggles on the admin permission
  grid, the demotion target in the team-membership state machine, and a full-licence consumer whose
  only purpose is access control. So with `admin`/`editor`/absent alone, a read-only stakeholder or
  auditor is either invisible or a full Editor — the two configurations Rally customers most often
  need to avoid. If that becomes a real problem it needs a **new ruling**, not a quiet re-add: the
  CHECK constraint, `ACCESS_LEVEL_PERMISSIONS`, the DTO enums, the SPA's `access-levels.ts` mirror and
  the generated client all have to move together, and the last attempt showed what happens when one of
  them lags — `AccessService` filtered its synthesized assignments on a hand-written
  `'admin' | 'editor'` pair in two places, so a granted row read as No Access. Use
  `isProjectAccessLevel`, never an inline comparison.

  Sourced evidence: `product-docs/projects/mini-rally/09_Gap_Audit/research/RALLY_PERMISSIONS_MODEL.md`.
- **Team-scoped Editor is DROPPED as an authorization scope** (ruling 2026-08-14, reversing the
  earlier "KEPT" ruling of the same day — recorded rather than deleted, because the next person to read
  the BA's §2.2 will reach for it again). The BA scopes an Editor's writes to their assigned Teams
  (§2.2, §3.2 "in assigned Teams"), and Rally has **no `Team` object and no team authorization scope**
  at all — `POST /user/<OID>/teammemberships/add` takes **project** refs, and "Team Member" is a
  presentational checkbox with auto-promotion to Editor. Our own research file said "do not build a
  team scope"; it was kept anyway because the BA models Teams as first-class.

  **What reversed it was our own schema, not Rally's docs.** A team scope can only restrict rows that
  CARRY a team, and `portfolio_items.team_id` and `work_items.team_id` are both nullable and mostly
  unset (195 of 206 local iterations name no team). `assertTeamScoped` therefore admitted every
  `teamId === null` row *by design* — so the boundary admitted the ordinary case, which makes it a
  filter with a security-sounding name rather than a control. It covered 3 of ~14 Editor-reachable
  writes and **no reads**: the worst available state, because it reads as a boundary in review and is
  not one. Finishing it honestly would have required making `team_id` MANDATORY on every
  Editor-writable row — a data-model change across portfolio, work items and iterations, plus
  team-scoped read models on every list, report and picker.

  **THE FRESH RULING ARRIVED: reinstated 2026-08-17.** `GAP-P4-RBAC-003` is a BA-confirmed P0 Fail —
  an Editor with no assigned Team read another team's Story in full and was offered `All Teams`,
  Pegasus and RTCAP in the selector — citing §2.2, §3.1–3.2, §7 and AC #3–#5. The paragraph above is
  kept because its objection was right, and because the BA's follow-up answer is what finally settles
  it. Asked directly whether `team_id` had to become mandatory, they ruled:

  > "Keep `team_id` nullable. Null means **Project Backlog**, accessible only to Workspace Admin and
  > Project Admin. Editor must select one of their assigned Teams when creating a Work Item and cannot
  > access team-less items. Enforce this consistently in API queries, lists, reports, search, pickers
  > and direct URLs. No DB migration or backfill is required."

  So the nullable column is not a gap to be closed — it is a **THIRD population with its own
  audience**, which is why no migration was needed. `AccessService` holds both halves and nothing else
  may re-implement either:

  - **`assertTeamInScope`** — the per-record decision. For an `editor`: no active roster row on any
    team actively linked to the project → `EDITOR_NO_TEAM_SCOPE` (AC1); another team's record →
    `TEAM_NOT_IN_SCOPE` (AC3); a record with NO team → `PROJECT_BACKLOG_ADMIN_ONLY`. That third code
    exists rather than reusing the second because "this is the Project Backlog" and "this is someone
    else's Team" are different facts and only one is something the reader can act on.
  - **`resolveTeamScope`** — the SAME decision in the shape a query needs, and every list, report,
    search and picker narrows through it. `{ unrestricted: true }` for a Workspace Admin, a
    per-project `admin`, or a principal with no level at all (whose refusal is
    `assertProjectPermission`'s — narrowing them to zero teams would turn a 403 into an empty grid,
    which reads as "this project has no work"). Otherwise their own team ids.
  - **`team_id IN (…)`, NEVER `IN (…) OR IS NULL`.** That OR-NULL form is right for ITERATIONS
    (`teamOrSharedTimebox` — a timebox with no team is a shared sprint) and wrong for WORK ROWS. The
    two rules sit in adjacent queries; say which one a predicate is when you write it.
  - **An empty array is an answer, not a missing filter.** `{ teamIds: [] }` must return nothing;
    flattening it to "unrestricted" hands that Editor the whole project, the same `null`-versus-`[]`
    trap `listReadableProjectIds` documents. Short-circuit rather than emitting `inArray(col, [])`.
  - **Create is a REQUIRED CHOICE, not a refusal to read.** An Editor omitting the Team gets
    `WORK_ITEM_TEAM_REQUIRED` (412), because `PROJECT_BACKLOG_ADMIN_ONLY` reads as "you may not open
    that" — true of a read and useless on a form.
  - **A per-project `admin` keeps All Teams AND the Project Backlog** (§3.1), so
    `GET /projects/:id/teams` narrows for a reader through `listProjectTeamsForReader` while the
    unscoped `listProjectTeams` stays internal — it is also the home of the "team must be linked to
    this project" rule, and a rule that cannot see every link would make an Editor unassignable
    inside their own team.
  - Reached from `WorkItemsService` on read-by-id, read-by-key, create, update (BOTH the current team
    and a moving destination) and delete. Pinned over real HTTP in
    `test/e2e/editor-team-scope.e2e.spec.ts`; the zero-team half is in `access.service.spec.ts`,
    because the e2e cannot express it without emptying a seeded principal's rosters, which other files
    measure.

  **A boundary the READS do not share is a filter with a security-sounding name** — that is the whole
  lesson of the removal note above, and it is why the ruling's own sentence lists lists, reports,
  search, pickers and direct URLs. A new read over work rows inherits nothing automatically: it must
  take the scope. What that cost, in one pass, and what each half is worth knowing for:

  - **`TeamReadScope` is exported from `@modules/access` and nowhere else.** Four modules had derived or
    re-declared it within a day of the rule landing; four copies of one decision table is the drift the
    rule exists to prevent. `libs/modules/{work-items,iterations,quality}/src/domain/team-read-scope.ts`
    re-export it and keep only their own SQL helpers.
  - **`scope` is a REQUIRED repository parameter**, not an optional one, in every port it reaches. A new
    call site that forgets the boundary is then a compile error rather than a silent widening.
  - **Every sub-resource of a work item is a disclosure of that work item.** `:id/activity`,
    `:id/labels`, `:id/relations`, `:id/milestones`, `:id/time-logs`, `:id/watchers`, `:id/attachments`
    and both attachment-download routes all loaded the row through the unscoped `getWorkItem`, so the
    record was refused while its Revision History, links, logged hours, watchers and attachment BYTES
    were not. `requireReadable` is the one scoped read path; a signed URL outliving the request is why
    the download pair was the worst of them. Comment threads had the same hole through
    `CollaborationService`, which is a different module and needed its own fix.
  - **Writes leak just as well as reads.** `bulk-release`, `bulk-iteration` and both reorder routes
    authorised the PROJECT in the body and never the rows, so a bulk call was the cheapest way to move
    another Team's work — or the Project Backlog's — with no UI involved. `loadBulkItems` now checks
    every row, all-or-nothing.
  - **A grid must not offer a row its own record endpoint refuses.** The Tasks tab narrows by
    `coalesce(task, parent, iteration)` while `GET /work-items/:taskId` read the row's own column, so a
    task under a teamed Story was listed and then refused. `resolveRowTeam` is the shared resolution,
    and it asks for the third tier only when the first two are null.
  - **Frozen Burndown history cannot be re-sliced, so a multi-team Editor gets NO series.** The
    `team_id IS NULL` snapshot row is a MEASURED All Teams row that spans teams they may not see, and
    summing the team rows is forbidden (this file, above). So `frozenSeriesScope` serves one team's own
    rows for a one-team reader and reports the series UNAVAILABLE for two or more, with
    `hasScheduledWork` still live — "work exists, this scope's history is unavailable" rather than
    "nothing scheduled". Arithmetically a sum would be exact for `iteration_daily_snapshots` alone; the
    release burnup cannot follow (a team-agnostic child counts inside every team row), and one report
    aggregating while its neighbour refuses is worse than both refusing.
  - **`All Teams` is not a lie for an Editor: it is `My Teams`.** Their default report scope returns
    that label, because `All Teams` would be false twice over — other teams, and the Project Backlog.
  - **Two REFUSALS on create, and they are not interchangeable.** Another team is `TEAM_NOT_IN_SCOPE`;
    no team at all is `WORK_ITEM_TEAM_REQUIRED`. On a form the reader needs to know which field to
    fill, which is also why `CreateIterationItemDto` gained an optional `teamId`: a SHARED iteration
    (195 of 206 local ones) has no team to inherit, so without it Add Item was closed to exactly the
    role §3.2 grants it to. A chosen team wins over the inherited one; the refusals still decide.
  - **What is still NOT narrowed, deliberately.** `activeProjects` / `activeSprints` on the Home strip
    count CONTAINERS, and `iterations.team_id` is unset on ~195 of 206 rows, so a strict predicate
    would drop exactly the shared sprints an Editor works in. And a Release Tracking Direct row's
    `childCount` / `progress` / `mismatches` stay scope-blind per RT-BR-05, so an Editor can infer
    aggregate counts for children of a Feature their team owns. Both are recorded here rather than
    quietly narrowed, because narrowing either would give one number two definitions.

  Everything else about Teams is unchanged: **delivery-model data, and a display filter.** Team
  membership, `team_members`, Team Status, Team Capacity and every report's team scoping are untouched
  — and note `RBE-06` grants `editor` from a team roster row, which IS Rally's model arrived at from
  the other direction.
- **A per-Project `Admin` has NO structural authority**, following the BA over Rally. §3.1 marks
  every structural row Hidden for Admin — create/edit/archive/restore/delete Project, create/edit/
  deactivate/restore Team, assign Project access and Team membership — and gives it Read-only on
  "View Project Details and Teams". Rally's Project Admin *does* configure its project and edit
  viewer/editor/team-member permissions, so this is deliberate. In code: `PATCH /projects/:id` and
  the two `:id/teams` link/unlink routes carry **`workspace:edit`** (workspace-tier, WA-only), not
  `project:edit`.

  **`project:edit` deliberately STAYS in the Admin set**, because it also gates label and
  workflow-status configuration — delivery configuration, which §3.1's own summary gives Admin
  ("`Admin` is powerful for delivery management") — and because `View Permission Model` is a §3.1
  Admin row gated on that code. So do not read "Admin must not hold `project:edit`" from the rule
  above; read "the structural routes must not be gated on it".

## Permissions reach a workspace ONCE

`db/permissions.catalog.ts` is the source of truth, but `db/seeds/bootstrap.ts` upserts the
per-workspace tier roles with `set: { name }` — deliberately, so re-seeding cannot clobber an
admin's edits to a role's permissions. The consequence is easy to miss: **a permission added to
the catalogue never reaches an existing workspace.** Phase 6 added `report:view` to
PROJECT_ADMIN and PROJECT_MEMBER and every pre-Phase-6 workspace kept its old array, so all five
report routes answered 403 to everyone except Workspace Admin — whose `workspace:*` grant is the
global anchor and hid the fault everywhere it was tested. Migration 0092 backfills it.

So: **a new permission needs a backfill migration**, not just a catalogue entry. Force it only
when the permission is genuinely new (nobody can have revoked what never existed); a permission
that already shipped must be merged, not forced, or the migration undoes someone's decision.

**Custom roles and the editable permission matrix are DELETED** (ruling 2026-08-14). AC-11 makes the
Permission Model read-only with no editable matrix, and three things agreed: the editing UI was already
dead code (`RoleEditorDialog` unreferenced, `role-capabilities.ts` with no live consumer), the catalogue
above is the single source of truth so a customisable matrix forks it, and — the deciding reason —
custom-role CRUD plus workspace-scoped tier-role assignment together re-create exactly the company-wide
over-grant migration 0111 removed. The READ-ONLY Permission Model tab stays; it is an AC-11 requirement,
not a leftover.

**The removal is deliberately sequenced, because deleting a role a user HOLDS revokes their access:**
(1) remove the editing routes and dead UI — a contract change with no data risk; (2) a **dry-run report**
of every custom role, everyone holding one, and every workspace-scoped tier assignment (the
`pnpm db:backfill:accepted-date` shape: report, never guess); (3) only then a migration that removes
them, converting any real assignment to its per-project equivalent. Step 3 is gated on reading step 2's
output against a real database — do not collapse the three into one change.

## Seeds: what a DEPLOYED database is allowed to contain

Three tiers, and only the first two ever reach a deployed environment:

| tier | file | contents | where |
|---|---|---|---|
| reference | `db/seeds/reference.ts` | `access.system_roles` from `db/permissions.catalog.ts` | every env, every deploy |
| bootstrap | `db/seeds/bootstrap.ts` | workspace + Entra SSO + `workspace_settings` + workspace-owned tier roles | every env, every deploy |
| fixtures | `db/seeds/demo.ts` (+ `second-project.ts`, `reference-extras.ts`) | NXP/PAY projects, work items, capacity plan, frozen report history | LOCAL and CI only |

`db/migrate.ts` gates the fixtures on `SEED_ON_DEPLOY` **and** refuses them outright under
`NODE_ENV=production`, which is what deployed migrator tasks run with and nothing else does. Develop
used to set `seed_on_deploy = true`, so a database people read as real carried a fixture project and a
capacity plan; a shared environment whose contents nobody can vouch for is worse than an empty one,
because every bug report starts by asking which rows were fixtures. Both environments are now `false`
and the `NODE_ENV` floor means flipping one back would not be enough to reach a deployed database.

`resetFixtureTables` (`db/seeds/reset.ts`) TRUNCATEs and is wired only into `pnpm db:seed:test` and the
Playwright global setup — never into `seed()` or a migration. Its `FIXTURE_TABLES` list covers delivery
data and touches nothing in `access.*`, `workspace.*` or `identity.*`, so roles, the workspace, SSO and
users survive a reset. It does not name `iteration_team_baselines` or `release_team_targets`; those are
removed by `CASCADE` through their `ON DELETE CASCADE` parents (migrations 0098/0099).

## New business data: migration, seed, or neither

Three categories, three different answers. Get the category right before writing either.

**Reference data** — see "Permissions reach a workspace ONCE" above. Catalogue entry PLUS a backfill
migration; the seed alone will not carry it to an existing workspace.

**A schema or grain change over existing rows** — backfill inside the same migration, always.
`0101_capacity_allocation_fixed_value.sql` is the model: it freezes TODAY's resolved value so no plan
total moves on deploy, and it re-implements the service's own fallbacks in SQL (a per-size `COALESCE`
over the default preliminary-estimate map, `LEFT JOIN` for a missing settings row) so a
partially-customised workspace cannot fall back wholesale. Never leave a column NULL or `''` and expect
a later read path to cope.

**Time-series history** — `iteration_daily_snapshots`, `iteration_team_baselines`,
`release_daily_snapshots`, `release_team_targets`. **Cannot be backfilled, ever.** They are measurements
of a past day, and that data never existed. `SnapshotCronService` writes them hourly at :05, only for
dates inside an iteration's or release's own window, and baseline capture is `onConflictDoNothing` so it
cannot be re-taken. A fresh environment's Burndown and Burnup therefore start empty and fill forward,
and Velocity needs a FINISHED iteration before it says anything. The reports state that explicitly
(`noBaseline`, `historyState`) rather than drawing a flat zero line — do not "fix" that by synthesising
history.

## Test Cases (Phase 7): the trigger, the nullable Work Product, and two exceptions to shared rules

`libs/modules/test-cases` — a Test Case is a project artifact, OPTIONALLY attached to a Work Item.

- **`test_cases.work_item_id` is NULLABLE, but only work-item-scoped routes are exposed.** Rally's
  Test Case has an optional Work Product; ours schema-supports that today (D2) but ships no
  standalone `Quality > Test Cases` surface yet — every route in Phase 7 requires the parent Work
  Item. `TestCasesService.requireReadableWorkItem` is the ONE authorization check the whole module
  has: a Test Case is readable exactly when its parent is (`getWorkItemForView`, which already
  asserts `work_item:view` + team scope), so this module adds no second team predicate of its own.
- **`last_verdict` / `last_run` / `last_result_id` are maintained EXCLUSIVELY by a DB trigger**
  (`trg_test_case_last_result`, migration 0129), never by the service — the same reasoning
  `trg_sync_accepted_date` and `trg_task_iteration_from_parent` already established. It recomputes
  from the latest LIVE Result (`order by run_date desc, created_at desc`) on every INSERT, UPDATE
  (of `run_date`/`verdict`/`deleted_at`/`test_case_id`) and DELETE, and sets all three back to NULL
  when no live Result remains. `UpdateTestCaseSchema` and `UpdateTestResultSchema` both omit these
  columns so the contract does not advertise what the trigger owns.
- **`entity_ref_type` widened to admit `test_case` and `test_result`** for attachments — a shared
  enum across `comments`, `attachments` and `milestone_artifacts` (§2.6), so widening it for one
  consumer technically opens the other two. Attachments got a deliberate `UploadPolicy` per new
  owner; `CollaborationService.assertCommentableEntity` REFUSES both new kinds explicitly (the SRS
  names no comment thread on either) — asserted in `collaboration.service.spec.ts`, or the widened
  enum would have silently become a feature nobody designed.
- **`Not Run` / `Not run yet` is a SECOND declared exception to `EMPTY_VALUE`** (BR10), alongside
  Capacity's `Dependencies` `0`. A Test Case with no Result renders these words, never `--` and
  never `0` — `lastVerdict`/`lastRun` being `null` is a fact (no Result exists yet), not an absent
  read.
- **The Type catalog (`work.test_case_types`) is per-PROJECT and modelled on `work.labels`**, but
  soft-hidden (`archived_at`) rather than hard-deleted, because `test_cases.type` stores the Type
  NAME as a text SNAPSHOT (D8) — a removed Type must keep rendering on every historical Test Case
  that used it (BR17, AC17). `POST`/`DELETE /projects/:id/test-case-types` are gated
  `workspace:edit` (Workspace-Admin-only, matching the structural project routes — see "A
  per-Project Admin has NO structural authority" above), **not** `project:edit`. The FIVE default
  Types are seeded twice, deliberately: migration 0129's one-time backfill for every project that
  existed before Phase G shipped, and `ProjectsService.createProject`'s own create-time loop (the
  same shape as `DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_STATUSES`) for every project created afterward — one seeds the
  past, the other seeds the future, and neither re-runs the other's job.
  BR17's union (the Detail page's Type select showing a historical value that is no longer live) is
  resolved entirely CLIENT-side, from the row's own snapshot string — no server `includeArchived`
  read exists, because there is no FK to look an archived row up by.

**Declared divergences from Rally, in Test Cases** (the reasons behind D2–D8 above, and the design
choices they replace):

1. **No standalone Test Case surface.** Rally has `Quality > Test Cases`, Test Folders and Test
   Sets; Phase 7 exposes Test Cases only through a Work Item. The schema is ready (`work_item_id`
   nullable); the UI is not built.
2. **No Test Folder, Test Set, Last Build, Tags, Color, or Expedite fields.** Rally's Test Case
   carries all of them; the SRS field list is exhaustive and names none.
3. **`Validation Input` is not required**, though Rally marks it required — the SRS makes `Name`
   the only required create field, and every content field starts blank.
4. **Rally's Test Case Result has a `Test Set` field; ours has none**, because there are no Test
   Sets.
5. **Test Case Type is per-PROJECT and admin-editable.** Rally's is a workspace-level customisable
   dropdown; per-project is the BA's model.

## Observability

The implementation lives in `@quynhonsemiconductor/observability` — shared with opshub, so fix it
there, not here. `libs/platform` keeps only re-export façades (`observability/index.ts`,
`context/request-context.ts`) so existing `@platform` import sites stay valid.

- **One AsyncLocalStorage.** `request-context.ts` re-exports the package's store. A
  second local instance would mean HTTP requests seed one store while the pino mixin
  reads another, and every request log line would silently lose `workspaceId`,
  `userId` and `correlationId`. `request-context.spec.ts` pins it.
- **Don't log `correlationId`/`workspaceId`/`userId` by hand.** The pino mixin adds
  them to every line from ALS, plus `trace.id`/`span.id`. Background work must call
  `withJobContext(name, fn)` or it has no context at all.
- **`@Span` is deliberate, not universal.** Auto-instrumentation already spans every
  HTTP request, DB query, cache call and AWS SDK call. Add `@Span` for internal
  fan-out, hot paths, or long-running domain operations — not for CRUD passthroughs,
  where it just duplicates the pg span underneath. 5 of 23 services have spans and
  that is fine.
- **Never put an id in a metric label.** The recorder signatures make it a type
  error; `normalizeRoute()` is the safety net when a route template isn't available.
  IDs go on spans and logs.
- **Metrics are emitted, not declared.** If you add a name to `METRIC_NAMES` in the
  package, something must record it — a spec asserts instruments == names. This repo
  previously declared 23 names and implemented none.
- **`OTEL_ENABLED` is live in both environments now** (`module.otel_agent_{api,worker}.enabled`,
  true once `otlp_endpoint` is set — it is, in both `infra/live/develop` and `infra/live/prod`).
  Spans, metrics, logs and traces all flow to Grafana Cloud (Mimir/Loki/Tempo) via the OTLP
  gateway, with dashboards, per-env alert thresholds, log-to-trace derived-field correlation
  and CloudWatch alarms for RDS/ECS/ALB/cache/SQS alongside it. This reverses the note that
  used to be here ("`OTEL_ENABLED` is `false` everywhere, no collector exists") — that was true
  before the stack was built out; do not trust it. See
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-26-observability-architecture-design.md` for the original
  design (now largely implemented, not aspirational) and `docs/runbooks/alerts/` for what to
  do when one of the four Grafana alert rules fires.

## Infrastructure invariants

- **`infra/live/{develop,prod}/main.tf` hold values, never resources.** The whole
  stack is `infra/modules/stack`, so the two environments cannot drift
  structurally — only in what they feed in. Adding a resource means editing the
  module once. Relocating an existing address needs a `moved{}` block in
  `infra/live/*/moved.tf`, or Terraform destroys and recreates it.
- **Security posture is not a per-environment knob.** The cache module always
  enables KMS at rest and TLS in transit, which is why `REDIS_URL` is always
  `rediss://`. ioredis turns TLS on from that scheme alone — no client option is
  needed, and `redis://` against these nodes simply fails to connect. Develop
  cannot be configured weaker than production here; sizing is the only difference.
- **Sessions live only in the cache.** That is why it sits outside the ECS tasks:
  it survives task replacement, so a deploy does not log everyone out. Replacing
  the cache node _does_ log everyone out — treat that as a user-visible change.
- **A secret REF is not always an ARN.** With `secrets_use_bundle`, the secrets module's
  `secret_arns` output returns `"<bundle arn>:<key>::"` — the ECS `valueFrom` form. ECS
  understands it; the Secrets Manager API does not, and rejects the whole string with
  `ValidationException: Invalid name`. So a value passed as a `secrets` entry is fine
  either way, but one passed as a plain **env var for the app to dereference at runtime**
  (`IDENTITY_HOME_SECRET_REF`, `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_SECRET_REF`) must be parsed.
  `SecretsManagerSecretResolver` is the one place that happens — it splits the key off the
  7-field ARN and reads it out of the bundle's JSON, which is what lets `use_bundle` flip
  in either direction with no app change. **Never call `GetSecretValue` with a raw ref.**
  This broke SSO login on develop for a day: every `POST /v1/bff/login/sso` was a 500 while
  the deploy, the migrator and the seed all reported success, because the seed stores the
  ref in `sso_connections.client_secret_ref` and only the *login* path dereferences it.
  IAM lists have the same trap from the other side and need `secret_iam_arns` instead.
- **An infra change alone does not take effect — it needs a deploy.** Terraform
  owns the task definition's environment and the Pages project's `API_ORIGIN`, but
  `ecs-service` sets `ignore_changes = [task_definition]` and Pages env changes
  only apply to the next deployment. Terraform registers the new revision; the
  deploy pipeline is what moves the service onto it. So `infra/**` is deliberately
  **not** in either deploy workflow's `paths-ignore`, and both have a
  `wait-for-infra` gate to sequence deploy-after-apply on the same sha. Re-adding
  `infra/**` there recreates a silent failure: the apply succeeds, the new
  definition is correct, nothing rolls, and the old value stays live. That is
  exactly how develop ran against a deleted cache endpoint (`valkey: down` on
  `/v1/readyz`) after the cache migration.
- **Don't roll the service from `infra-apply` instead.** Terraform's newest task
  definition carries a new _image_, so rolling onto it there would ship app code
  ahead of `Run database migrations`.
- **REMOVING infra the running code still uses needs the deploy FIRST.** The normal
  order is apply-then-deploy (`wait-for-infra` gates it), and for an addition that is
  right — the code arrives after the resource exists. For a REMOVAL it is backwards,
  and the window is not theoretical: deleting the SNS topic in #394 left the old
  worker publishing to an ARN that no longer existed, the resilience breaker for
  `sns.publishOutboxEvent` opened, and six `outbox_events` rows burned all five
  attempts to `status = 'failed'` in the seconds before the new worker rolled. `failed`
  is excluded from every relay's fetch, so those rows were stranded SILENTLY — the
  projection looked healthy precisely because nothing was left pending. Migration 0103
  is the cleanup; the rule is the fix. Expand/contract: ship the code that no longer
  needs the resource, let it roll, then remove the resource in a second change.
- **ElastiCache cluster ids and replication-group ids share one namespace.**
  `CreateReplicationGroup` fails with `InvalidParameterValue: Cannot have a
cluster and replication group with same identifier` while a same-named cluster
  is still deleting. Terraform runs an unrelated destroy and create in parallel,
  so a same-name migration between the two resource types needs two applies — the
  plan cannot show you this.

## Environment flags that look wrong and are not

Two settings in `infra/live/*` read like mistakes. Both are deliberate; changing
either opens a hole or leaks API surface.

- **`NODE_ENV=production` in DEVELOP.** Not a copy-paste error. `devLoginAllowed`
  in `@quynhonsemiconductor/identity` is `nodeEnv !== 'production'`, so flipping develop to
  `development` would expose the **passwordless** `/v1/bff/dev-login` on a public
  host — anyone knowing a seeded address (`dev@qnsc.dev` is in this repo) could sign
  in as that user with no password. Develop deliberately requires real Entra SSO.
  If a local passwordless login is wanted, run the app locally where `.env` sets
  `NODE_ENV=test`; do not change the deployed value.
  (`LOG_PRETTY` is pinned `"false"` in infra, so JSON logs do not depend on this.)

- **`SWAGGER_ENABLED` unset (= off) in BOTH environments.** `/api/docs` publishes the
  full endpoint inventory and every schema, unauthenticated, and both API hosts are
  public. Explore the API locally instead — `.env` sets `SWAGGER_ENABLED=true`, so
  `localhost:3000/api/docs` works while developing. It used to be derived from
  `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`, which meant any non-prod-labelled environment
  published it without anyone choosing to; that is why it is now explicit opt-in.

## Auth model (read before touching a guard)

- **Browser sessions are BFF, not bearer.** The SPA holds no tokens. It talks to a
  same-origin Cloudflare Pages Function (`apps/web/functions/v1/[[path]].ts`) that
  proxies to the API, and authentication rides an opaque `__Host-rally_session`
  cookie backed by a server-side Valkey session. Bearer still works for machine
  clients — `JwtAuthGuard` handles both paths.
- **One guard, one decorator.** `PolicyGuard`
  (`libs/modules/access/src/interface/http/policy.guard.ts`) is the single
  authorization decision point. Controllers carry `@AuthPolicy()`; routes carry
  `@RequirePermission(...)` from `@modules/access`. The signature is tier-safe by
  overload: a workspace-tier code takes NO scope, a project-tier code REQUIRES one
  (`{ from: 'param'|'query'|'body', field }`, or `{ resource, from, field }` to
  resolve the project by loading the row). Passing the wrong shape is a compile
  error, deliberately. `@Auth()` is authentication ONLY — it grants every
  authenticated caller, so use it only where the surface is self-scoped
  (`me/*`, `notifications/*`) or runs around a session existing (`auth/*`).
  The old `@platform` `RequirePermission` + the `PermissionGuard` from
  `@quynhonsemiconductor/identity` are gone; so is `@RequireProjectPermission`.
- **A route with no `@RequirePermission` is OPEN, not denied.** `PolicyGuard`
  returns `true` when it finds no metadata, and `@AuthPolicy()` sets none. That is
  why `test/route-policy.ratchet.spec.ts` counts undecorated handlers and only
  ever lets the number fall.
- **Permissions are NEVER in the token.** The access token carries identity only.
  `PolicyGuard` resolves them from the database on every check, through one cached
  read per (workspace, user) (`authz:assign:<ws>:<user>`, 5-min TTL) that serves
  both tiers. Write paths call `AccessService.invalidateUser(s)` after commit, so a
  grant or revocation lands on the user's NEXT request — on every replica. Do not
  reintroduce `claims.permissions`: that snapshot is what forced the old
  authorization-epoch counter, and the epoch is gone with it.
- **A principal's `permissions` array is inert.** Nothing reads it. An e2e fixture
  cannot grant itself anything by declaring a list — it needs a real assignment
  (see `ensureViewerGrant` in `test/e2e/support/flow-harness.ts`).
- **Project scope is additive.** A project-scoped role can only add permissions; it
  cannot subtract a workspace-wide grant. Known limitation, tracked in
  `RALLY_HARDENING_PLAN.md` (R3).
- **CSRF is enforced by a hook, not per route.** `requiresCsrfProtection`
  (`libs/platform/src/http/csrf.ts`) is the one place the policy lives. A raw
  `fetch` write in the SPA must send `X-CSRF-Token` via `withCsrfHeader`.
- **Two paths fail open** when Valkey is down: the token denylist and the rate
  limiter. Each emits BOTH a `securityFailOpen` log field (matched by a CloudWatch
  metric filter + alarm) and a `security.fail_open` counter. The `FailOpenControl`
  union in the package is the one source for both, and `fail-open.spec.ts` greps
  `infra/live/*` to prove the field the package emits is the field the Terraform
  filters on. (The union still declares `authz_epoch` / `authz_epoch_bump` from the
  deleted epoch service — nothing emits them now; drop them on the package's next
  major.)
- **The permission cache degrades, it does not fail open.** A read or write error
  falls back to the database, so authorization stays correct and only latency
  suffers. It logs a warning and is deliberately NOT tagged `securityFailOpen` —
  that field means "a security control was skipped", which is not what happens here.

## API tokens: four things that are correct in isolation and wrong in the graph

Machine credentials (`identity.api_tokens`, migration 0125). The design rationale is in the migration;
these are the integration facts that cost a debugging cycle each, all four found by
`test/e2e/api-tokens.e2e.spec.ts` and none of them visible to a unit test.

- **The resolver module must be `@Global` AND export the DI token.** `JwtAuthGuard` is constructed in
  whichever module uses `@Auth()`, so an optional dependency bound only inside `ApiTokensModule`
  resolves to `undefined` in every one of them — the guard keeps its old behaviour and every API token
  answers 401 on a route that should accept it. `IdentityModule` is `@Global` for exactly this reason
  with its BFF bridge; the pattern is not decoration.
- **A post-authentication guard cannot live on the controller.** Nest runs controller-level guards
  BEFORE route-level ones, so `@UseGuards(RejectApiTokenAuthGuard)` on the class ran before `@Auth()`
  had authenticated anything, read an unset `apiTokenId`, and allowed every token through — a token
  could mint another token, which makes a leaked one permanent. Both guards now go in ONE `UseGuards`
  array (`SessionAuthOnly`), where array order is execution order.
- **`z.date()` in a response DTO breaks Swagger metadata, not the DTO.** `nestjs-zod` throws "Date
  cannot be represented in JSON Schema" when the OpenAPI factory runs, which takes down every suite
  that boots through `bootstrapApp` — it surfaced in `csrf-protection.e2e.spec.ts`, nowhere near
  tokens. Response timestamps are `z.string().datetime()` like every other response DTO, and the
  service→wire conversion is one exported mapper.
- **`WorkspaceService` deep-imports `ApiTokensService`**, not the barrel. `@modules/api-tokens`
  re-exports the module and its controllers, which import `@modules/identity`, which imports
  `@modules/workspace` — a cycle that leaves the injected type `undefined` and fails as "argument at
  index [11]" with no name.

Two behavioural notes worth knowing before changing either:

- **`scopes` narrow; they never grant.** `PolicyGuard` asks both sides — the database-resolved
  permissions and the token's scopes — whether they grant the required code (`grantsUnderTokenScopes`).
  It is two-sided rather than an array intersection because either side can hold a wildcard, and an
  intersection gets both directions wrong: an admin whose baseline is `workspace:*` minting a
  `work_item:view` token has no literal overlap, and neither does a `work_item:*` scope over a
  `work_item:view` baseline. Permissions are still never READ from the token, so this is not the
  `claims.permissions` snapshot returning.
- **Offboarding revokes tokens, and cache invalidation is not enough.** Dropping the permission cache
  makes the principal powerless but leaves the credential AUTHENTICATING for up to a year, and a live
  401-vs-403 distinction is the difference between a credential that is dead and one that is merely
  idle. `removeMember` and a suspension both call `revokeAllForUser`, best-effort so a transient
  failure cannot roll back a removal that already committed.

## Sibling repo

`opshub` (`../opshub`) is a second product on the same architecture, and the
boilerplate is meant to stay identical: workflows, `infra/`, `libs/platform`,
`libs/shared-kernel`, `apps/*/bootstrap`, `apps/web/src/{shared,app}`. A fix to any
of those here should be ported there in the same week, and vice versa.

**A difference between the two repos is either declared in `docs/DIVERGENCE.md` or it
is drift.** Read that before "aligning" anything — several differences are deliberate
(opshub is single-tenant with `self|team|dept|region` scopes and dotted permission
codes; rally is workspace-scoped with `ns:*` wildcards).

rally is ahead on infra, CI gates, BFF auth and test depth; opshub is ahead on
authorization scope dimensions, delegation and IdP role mapping. Both now resolve
permissions from the database — see
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-28-auth-convergence.md` for the shared model and the
ordered list of what opshub still has to do. Wider audit:
`OPSHUB_RALLY_PARITY_PLAN.md` and `RALLY_HARDENING_PLAN.md` one directory up.

What may live in a _shared package_ is a separate rule, recorded in
`qnsc-app-platform/docs/ADMISSION-TEST.md`: divergence that would be a security
defect or a cross-repo contract break belongs there; divergence that would merely be
inconsistent stays in the product.

## Conventions

- Conventional commits, scope required for `feat` and `security` (`feat(auth): …`).
  release-please owns versions and the changelog — never bump by hand.
- Errors: throw the domain exceptions from `@platform` (`NotFoundException`,
  `ConflictException`, `PermissionDeniedException`, …) with a stable code the
  frontend can branch on; the global filter maps them to HTTP.
- New env vars go in `libs/platform/src/config/env.schema.ts` (validated at boot,
  fail fast) **and** `.env.example` **and** CI **and** `infra/live/*`. Booleans use
  the `booleanish` helper — `z.coerce.boolean()` turns `"false"` into `true`.
